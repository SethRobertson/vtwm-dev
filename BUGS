A LISTING OF BUGS
=================

  * Windows don't resize correctly when resize is called from a menu; you
    have to use a keybinding to resize it, i.e., 
    'Button2 = m : window | frame : resize' --- DSE

  * Behavior of transients on the virtual desktop, when the real screen is
    not at (0,0), is almost unpredictable.  Hence the
    FixTransientVirtualGeometries variable, new to 5.3, which is not
    guaranteed to work in every case. --- DSE

  * Move and resize from a menu not belonging to the window in question
    don't behave the same; This may be just a clarification of DSE's
    first bug. --- djhjr

  * Windows won't move correctly when move is called from a menu in the
    icon manager; This may also be a clarification of DSE's first bug.
    --- djhjr

  * The behavior of moving the virtual desktop window will be less than
    perfect if its dimensions as specified do not work out to exact whole
    numbers. --- djhjr

  * Icon borders will not do 3D, and I don't want to to mess with it.
    The icons are 3D when UseThreeDIconManagers is set, however, and look
    good with IconBorderWidth set to 0. --- djhjr

  * The code to vertically center a door name in the window is correct.
    It just won't appear so, due to the window and font heights. Play with
    the door geometry. --- djhjr

  * Something is corrupting titlebutton names, or TBWindow structures
    aren't properly handled? A trap is hacked in. --- djhjr

  * Behavior of managed windows when used as transients on the virtual
    desktop, when the real screen is not at (0,0), is sometimes flawed.
    Hence the FixManagedVirtualGeometries variable, new to 5.4.4, which
    is also guaranteed to not work in every case. --- djhjr

  * The BeNiceToColormap variable does, but the rendition isn't perfect.
    My Tuit isn't round enough yet. --- djhjr

  * When the WarpCursor resource is set, but the WarpWindows resource is
    not: The screen warp to de-iconifying windows not on the real screen
    is unpredictable at best. A kludge is in to "fix" it. --- djhjr

  * External image support for titlebar buttons is quite primitive:
    They're not scaled to the size of the buttons, transparent areas of
    pixmaps are always the titlebar color, and only the opaque areas of
    those receive pointer events. --- djhjr
