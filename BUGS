A LISTING OF BUGS
=================

  * Windows don't resize correctly when resize is called from a menu; you
    have to use a keybinding to resize it, i.e., 
    'Button2 = m : window|frame : resize' --- DSE

  * Behavior of transients on the virtual desktop, when the real screen is
    not at (0,0), is almost unpredictable.  Hence the
    'FixTransientVirtualGeometries' variable, new to 5.3, which is not
    guaranteed to work in every case. --- DSE

  * Move and resize from a menu not belonging to the window in question
    don't behave the same; This may be just a clarification of DSE's
    first bug. --- djhjr

  * Windows won't move correctly when move is called from a menu in the
    Icon Manager; This may also be a clarification of DSE's first bug.

  * The behavior of moving the Virtual Desktop window will be less than
    perfect if its dimensions as specified do not work out to exact whole
    numbers. --- djhjr

  * Icon borders will not do 3D, and I don't want to to mess with it.
    The icons are 3D when UseThreeDIconManagers is set, however, and look
    good with IconBorderWidth set to 0. --- djhjr

  * The code to vertically center a Door name in the window is correct.
    It just won't always show it, due to the window and font heights.
    Play with the Door geometry. --- djhjr

  * Sometimes the window manager doesn't accept the next button click
    after using a non-root menu. I don't think I did this... --- djhjr

  * Haven't figured out how to properly draw the top frame segment when
    3D borders are used with squeezed titles; look for the define
    'WHEN_I_FIGURE_OUT_WHY_THIS_BORDER_DOESNT_APPEAR' in resize.c and
    util.c if you want a crack at it. --- djhjr

  * Something is corrupting titlebutton names. Or TBWindow structures
    aren't properly freed. --- djhjr
