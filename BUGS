A LISTING OF BUGS
=================

  * Windows don't resize correctly when resize is called from a menu; you
    have to use a keybinding to resize it, i.e., 
    `Button2 = m : window|frame : resize' --- DSE

  * Behavior of transients on the virtual desktop, when the real screen is
    not at (0,0), is almost unpredictable.  Hence the
    FixTransientVirtualGeometries variable, new to 5.3, which is not
    guaranteed to work in every case. --- DSE
