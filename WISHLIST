WISHES FOR THE FUTURE OF VTWM
=============================

  * From vtwm-5.1 spawned two independent versions, vtwm-5.2 and vtwm-5.2b. 
    The features added to 5.2b are different from the ones added to 5.2, and
    I based my version(s) on 5.2 rather than 5.2b since in 5.2 the features
    were, in my humble opinion, more useful, while in 5.2b the new stuff was
    mostly `chrome' (e.g., XPM support, etc.).  I was seriously considering
    adding the features from 5.2b into 5.3, but I didn't have enough time.

    I would like to see most of the features from 5.2b merged into the next
    version, especially the color XPM support and m4 pre-processing of the
    *twmrc file.  See below for more info. --- DSE

    Summary feature list for version 5.2:
    
    * Added m4 pre-processing of the *twmrc file. courtesy of Dave Edmondson.
    * Added :random color specification, which generates colors on the fly.
    * Color XPM support for icons and buttons.
    * 3D appearance on menus, titles, icons.
    * Moving in and out of desktop.
    * Opaque resizing available.
    * Both OpaqueResize and OpaqueMove may specify lists of windows as
      opposed to being "global".
    * Can direct focus through desktop at real windows. When enabled, the
      desktop windows also indicate the focus highlight by using the border.
    * regexps can be used for lists in the vtwmrc.
    * Size information is displayed during both move and resize.
    * Size information can be centered in the screen.
    * Desktop size may be specified in multiples of real screen.
    * Can "paste" a new name into a door.
    * Places property on root window giving virtual coordinates, in case
      other programs want to use this info. (e.g. xpostit).
    * Now uses a blank/icon startup screen while initialising.
    * Many bugfixes, especially to do with desktop stacking order and
      iconification/deiconification of the desktop windows.

  * A better way of implementing StickyAbove and "VTWM Profile".
