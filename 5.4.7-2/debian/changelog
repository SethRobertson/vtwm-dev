vtwm (5.4.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add build-dependency on librplay3-dev to fix FTBFS (librplay3-dev does not
    depend on libc6-dev for some reason, so I didn't catch this when scrubbing
    my chroot.  Sigh.)

vtwm (5.4.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge new upstream release.
    + This release is dedicated to the memory of David J. Hawkey, Jr., who
      passed away in 2004.  VTWM is now team-developed by the VTWM hackers at
      http://www.vtwm.org/, and Callum Gibson is the release manager.
    + See /usr/share/doc/vtwm/HISTORY for a comprehensive list of new
      features, behavior changes, and bug fixes.
  * Bump Debian standards version to 3.6.2; no changes necessary.
  * Update URL in package description.
  * Tweak Debian rules file:
    + Explicitly set optimization to -O0 if DEB_BUILD_OPTS contains "noopt".
    + Export the CDEBUGFLAGS variable instead of manually passing it to Make.
    + Make shell style tweaks.
  * Remove Debian patch to remove increment of yylineno variable from parse.c;
    upstream has "#ifdef"ed it out so that it can be restored for systems
    where lex doesn't define and use this variable for itself.
  * Ship more upstream documentation files: 4.6.ANNOUNCE, 4.6.README,
    4.7.README, DEVELOPERS, HISTORY, and SOUND.
  * Remove "SunkFocusWindowTitle" configuration parameter from
    debian/system.vtwmrc-menu, since it is no longer supported.
  * Fix menu-method file to background launched apps, so the window manager
    doesn't wedge.  Whoops.  Thanks to Matthew A. Micholson for the patch!
    (Closes: #319510)

vtwm (5.4.6b-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to new upstream version.  (Closes: #193695)
    + Fixes problem where certain window types (often transient dialogs) cause
      VTWM to restart itself.  (Closes: #286951)
    + The "VirtualDesktopFont" configuration variable is now documented under
      that name, instead of the incorrect "VirtualFont".  (Closes: #201738)
  * Resync Debian patches with new version.
    + Fix for gram.y is now upstream.
    + Replace VTWMLIBDIR symbol with VTWMCONFDIR since all we use it for is
      installation of the configuration file.  Create a new TWMCONFDIR symbol,
      which we use to locate twm's configration file.  If Imake defines
      EtcX11Directory, use a subdirectory of ETCX11DIR for vtwm's
      configuration; otherwise, use a subdirectory of LIBDIR.  (This is an
      improved -- and hopefully upstream-tolerable -- version of a patch
      previously applied.)
  * Update copyright information:
    + Update URL to new source version and hosting location.
    + Update list of copyright holders, authors and contributors based on
      current version of manual page.
    + Undocument Martin "Joey" Schulze as a Debian package author, as he
      wasn't responsible for *this* packaging (which has been done at least 3
      times from scratch in the past 10 years, most recently by me).
      Acknowledge Joey's previous packaging.
    + Update my copyright notice.  I have never signed a written instrument
      assigning my copyright in the packaging desiderata to Software in the
      Public Interest, Inc., so it's probably misleading to claim the
      copyright belongs to them.
  * Rewrite package's extended description based on current information from
    upstream.
  * Update build-dependencies to depend on real X protocol header and library
    development packages, rather than xlibs-dev, which is a dummy package
    nowadays.
  * Update menu item quoting functions in vtwm's menu-method file to align
    them with twm's, which are a little easier to understand.
  * Add support for launching other window managers to menu-method file, using
    VTWM's f.startwm function.  Add 10 points to vtwm command's alternatives
    priority per Debian Policy section 11.8.4.  (Closes: #194158)
  * Re-case VTWM's name in its menu entry per upstream usage.
  * Use a debian/compat file instead of the DH_COMPAT variable in the rules
    file, per debhelper(7).
  * Add "FixManagedVirtualGeometries" and "FixTransientVirtualGeometries" to
    system.vtwmrc-menu file per suggestion from Neil Stewart; this should fix
    various problems with placement of transient and pop-up dialog windows.
    (Closes: #194110, #225945)
  * Grab fix to twm's parse.c from XFree86 CVS (revision 1.9, 2001/04/23) that
    fixes line numbers in error messages about the vtwmrc file from being
    double their correct value.  (Closes: #201741)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.6.1; no changes necessary.
  * Quote strings in menu file, per Lintian.
  * Tidy up the manual page in several respects:
    + Add copyright notice to the manual page itself, copied from the
      copyright information on twm's source files in X11R4, from which VTWM
      was forked.
    + Fix up the .TH directive:
      - Downcase the command name (rendering a command's name in full caps is
        a presentation decision).
      - Change the date to reflect my modifications.
      - Indicate the source as "VTWM 5.4.6b", not "X11R4-6", since this
        manual page is independently maintained by the VTWM hackers.
    + Fix up the NAME section:
      - Remove spurious paragraph break at the beginning of the section.
      - Use \- instead of - to separate the manpage's name and summary and so
        that mkwhatis is less easily confused.  (See man(7).)
    + Rename the SYNTAX section to SYNOPSIS.  (See man(7).)
    + Use an macros for type face selection in the SYNOPSIS section.
    + Use \- instead of - in the SYNOPSIS section to notate literal dashes
      that the user will type (e.g., when specifying command-line options).
    + Rename the SIGNALS section to ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS (after SUSv3
      manpages).
    + Rename the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section to ENVIRONMENT.  (See
      man(7).)
    + Use "an" typeface macros instead of roff \f escapes for font changes
      where practical in the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS, BUGS, FILES,
      ENVIRONMENT, COPYRIGHT, and SEE ALSO sections.
    + Quote multi-word arguments to the .SH macro in the ASYNCHRONOUS
      EVENTS and AUTHORS AND CONTRIBUTORS sections.
    + Use \(oq and \(cq named characters instead of literal double-quotes
      in the BUGS section.
    + Italicize signal names in the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section.
    + Put a newline at the ends of sentences per the GNU Roff info
      documentation.
    + Move the SEE ALSO section to the end of the page.
    + Update COPYRIGHT section based on the information I gathered from
      trawling the source tree.

vtwm (5.4.5a-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: s/CFLAGS/CDEBUGFLAGS/; Imake-using packages should use
    CDEBUGFLAGS instead of CFLAGS.  Using CFLAGS didn't hurt vtwm but it
    doesn't work in the general case.
