INTRODUCTION

If you use vtwm, perhaps you would like to set or change the
background of the "Virtual Desktop" panner window...

This posting provides a simple program, based on sxpm, xMoveIt,
and xsetroot, that draws a pixmap in *any* existing window.

Instead of drawing a pixmap, you can make it set a solid background
color for the window -- which is useful to cancel the effects of a
previous nexpm invocation!

There is a special parameter for operating on the vtwm panner
window; otherwise, the target window is specified either by name, by
numeric ID, or by using the mouse pointer.

It is possible that the Compensate() routine, which is the only
original code here, is vtwm-specific.

There is probably no use for this technology except when applied to
the panner window. Putting a pixmap in the background of an xterm
window may be hazardous to your mental health.

INSTALLATION

xmkmf
make

COMPATIBILITY

My version of xpm is, from README, "3.0     (91/10/03)";
older xpm libraries will not understand the built-in default
"plaid" pixmap.

OTHER USES

The same hack could be applied to xmartin, xv, xloadimage, xneko, or
anything else, if you have source for them, to make them capable of
displaying in other windows.

DISCLAIMER

I'm not responsible. This is free stuff, and I wrote very little of
it. Enjoy!
