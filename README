This is a new release of vtwm which incorporates the nice features in ctwm, 
courtesy of Claude Lecommandeur.  Other bugfixes and patches are also lurking 
inside and the file CHANGES-5.2 gives an overall feature list.

Here follows the vtwm-5.1 README:
---------------------------------

This is based on vtwm-5.0.tar.Z, with the addition of all the
patches I know of except for the "dwim" patch.
The patch authors' names were added to the manual entry.

It also includes my own enhancements, of course.

Although many files are unchanged from vtwm-5.0.tar.Z,
I mean for this to supplant that version, so the next
person to take a swing at vtwm will start with my changes!

There is no excuse for not including raisedelay and
dynamic squeezed titles and dynamic warpring in every
version of twm, including twm, vtwm, tvtwm, and ctwm.
These are essential features.

RealScreen colors and bitmap are useful.
A sample realscreen.bm file is included.

Colored entries in the TWM-Windows menu are nice to have.
Being able to turn autopan off and on at will is also handy.

I rarely use the "snug" functions.

Panner foreground and bitmap are superseded by my "nexpm"
program: see the nexpm directory for details.

============================================================

The nexpm directory contains a program that decorates
your panner window.

The vtwmrc directory contains a makefile and scripts that help
maintain the colorlists in your .vtwmrc

========

vtwm has no maintainer, as far as I know.

Now I am finished with vtwm; somebody else can take a turn next.
