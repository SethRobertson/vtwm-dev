A SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM VTWM-5.2.2 TO VTWM-5.3
================================================
    
    The file `ChangeLog' in the vtwm-5.3 archive contains more detailed info
    concerning changes made since version 5.0.

    New Variables:
    --------------
        DontInterpolateTitles               (from tvtwm)
        FixTransientVirtualGeometries       (BUG WORKAROUND!!)
        MenuTitleFont                       (from tvtwm)
        NailedAbove                         (aliased to StickyAbove)
        NoDefaultMouseAndKeyboardBindings
        NoDefaultTitleButtons
        NoIconifyIconManagers               (from Paul Falstad)
        StayUpOptionalMenus                 (from Paul Falstad)
        StickyAbove                         (like the same feature in tvtwm)
        WarpSnug
        WarpToTransients                    (from Paul Falstad)

    New Functions:
    --------------
        f.nail                              (aliased to f.stick)
        f.stickyabove                       (or f.nailedabove)
        f.warp                              (from Paul Falstad)
        f.warpclassnext                     (from Paul Falstad)
        f.warpclassprev                     (from Paul Falstad)
        f.warptonewest                      (from Paul Falstad)

    Other New Features:
    -------------------
        The window manager will now execute a special function called 
        "VTWM Profile" upon the initial startup or restarting of the window
        manager.  This may prove useful in certain situations.  For example,
        say you want AutoPan to have a value but you want autopanning 
	turned off initially:
        
            AutoPan 25
            .
            .
            
            function "VTWM Profile" {
                .
                .
                
                f.autopan # turns it off (you can turn it back on later)
                .
                .
            }

        The feature was created for this very specific purpose in mind, but 
        the possibilities are endless.

    Other fixes:
    ------------
        autopanning (wouldn't work when mouse was over a window on the edge
            of the screen sometimes)
        nailed windows will *always* go on the real screen, wherever the real
            screen is on the virtual desktop.
        small fix of an obvious bug in the source regarding nailed windows'
            representations on the virtual desktop
        patches to Imakefile

    Undocumented functions now documented (please use these at your own risk):
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        f.cut
        f.cutfile
        f.file
        f.movescreen
        f.twmrc [same thing as f.restart anyway]
        f.version

WHAT IS VTWM?
=============

    vtwm (which stands for `Virtual Tab Window Manager') is based upon the
    twm window manager, but adds extra functionality in the form of a
    VIRTUAL DESKTOP.  The virtual desktop is an area larger than the
    physical screen, where windows can be placed.  On the real screen, a
    portion of the virtual desktop the size of the real screen can be seen. 
    The `virtual desktop window', of course, facilitates navigation around
    the desktop and manipulation of windows in the desktop.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

  * Paul Falstad <pf@z-code.z-code.com> for f.warp, one of the things I
    really wanted to see, among other related things.
  * kudos to Chris P. Ross <cross@eng.umd.edu> for letting me use some of
    his code from tvtwm (MenuTitleFont and DontInterpolateTitles).
  * Marty Leisner <leisner@eso.mc.xerox.com>, small patches to Imakefile.
  * Kaur <kaur@stacken.kth.se> for pointing out f.movescreen to me, and
    inspiring me to look for other undocumented stuff and take a stab at
    documenting it.
