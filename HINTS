A LISTING OF MAKE HINTS
=======================

  * If, during the build, you get complaints of an undefined 'yylineno',
    remove the "extern" keyword from the declaration in gram.y. Likewise,
    if 'yywrap' is reported as undefined, add the line "#define yywrap() 1"
    to lex.l. They're both expected to be defined and initialized in lex's
    skeleton file, but some Linux systems seem to choke on these. --- djhjr

  * Along the same line, many reports of problems with bison under Linux.
    Stick with yacc. It seems less problematic. --- djhjr

  * If, in the link phase, you get complaints of an unresolved function
    'XpmReadFileToPixmap()', it's because you've built VTWM with XPM image
    support and either you don't have the XPM library available, or it's
    not a recent enough version (3.4h is the earliest I know of). Read the
    comments in Imakefile and/or Makefile.QNX. --- djhjr

  * If you expected HTML or Postscript man pages on build completion, or
    VTWM doesn't fall back on TWM's system resource files on startup, read
    the comments in Imakefile and/or Makefile.QNX. --- djhjr

A LISTING OF RUNTIME HINTS
==========================

  * If you use a SqueezeTitle list for versions prior to 5.4.4, you may
    want to check the man page to see if 5.4.4's enterpretation of the
    resource's list parameters fouls your setup. --- djhjr
