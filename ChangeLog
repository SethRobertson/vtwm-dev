	* F_LOWER now lowers the window in the virtual desktop as well
	  (menus.c)
	* fixed Identify to show patchlevel and say vtwm instead of
	  Twm (menus.c)
	* Virtual desktop window iconifies and un-iconifies properly, you
	  can also move it (events.c)
	* added patchlevel (patchlevel.h)
	* updated version -- removed 0 (version.c)
	* adding SCCS info to files
	* released patch to net
	* left to do:
	  * stacking order of nailed windows strange (not really,
	    nailed windows are the children of the little square,
	    while other windows are the children of the larger window,
	    so nailed windows will not appear over other windows in
	    the virtual desktop unless the others were lowered below
	    the square)
	  * shaped icons? (need a standard, was a local hack to tvtwm)

	* botched ask_user stuff in add_window, fixed that up.
	* removed broken copy from export.
