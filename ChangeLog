dsembr01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu (Darren S. Embry)

	Tuesday, 1994 January 4, 16:43:32 EST

                turned back on via f.autopan.

	Monday, 1994 January 3, 20:49:22 EST

        Monday, 1994 January 3, 19:29:07 EST / dsembr01
                [twm.c] The "VTWM Profile" function is now executed after
                starting/restarting the window manager.

        Friday, 1993 November 26, 15:37:01 EST / dsembr01
                [vtwm.man] Some previously undocumented functions have now

                        f.cut
                        f.cutfile

                        f.twmrc [same as f.restart anyway]
                        f.version

        Saturday, 1993 November 6, 19:03:28 EST / dsembr01
                [desktop.c] small bug fix regarding representations of
                nailed windows on the virtual desktop; it was obvious and
                obviously unintentional.

        Tue Nov  2 20:05:44 EST 1993 dsembr01
                WarpSnug

        Wed Oct 27 12:29:38 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                MenuTitleFont (this code also came from tvtwm)

        Tue Oct 26 19:41:04 EDT 1993 pf@z-code.z-code.com (Paul Falstad)
                NoIconifyIconManagers
                StayUpOptionalMenus
                WarpToTransients

                f.warpclassprev
                f.warptonewest

        Mon Oct 25 21:08:40 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                If StickyAbove is set, f.nail will raise all sticky windows
                to make sure nailed windows stay above.

        Mon Oct 25 19:48:33 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                FixTransientVirtualGeometries, a BUG WORKAROUND!!
                  (Any better ideas, folks? -- DSE)

        Mon Oct 25 17:13:00 EDT 1993 dsembr01 
                DontInterpolateTitles, from tvtwm -- thanks to
                  cross@eng.umd.edu (Chris P. Ross) for letting me use his
                  code.

        Sun Oct 24 16:16:52 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                f.lower now won't lower the window if it is nailed down and
                StickyAbove is set.

        Tue Oct 19 18:03:35 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                StickyAbove (I didn't take any of the code for this from
                  tvtwm; just the idea.)

        Mon Oct 18 21:14:04 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Fixed autopanning bug that would *sometimes* not allow
                AutoPan to work if the focus was on a window, since 
                the autopan windows (on the edges of the real screen)
                weren't raised.

        Sat Oct 16 18:23:43 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Nailed windows now *always* go on the real screen, wherever
                the real screen is.

        Wed Oct 13 12:21:54 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                aliased "f.stick" to "f.nail", for greater compatibility
                (or less incompatibility) between .vtwmrc and .tvtwmrc,
                just for the hell of it.

        Mon Oct 11 21:06:09 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Fixed a bug that would make the window manager mess up if
                ``AutoPan 100'' and ``AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen
                100'' (a.k.a.  ``NaturalAutoPanBehavior'') were set.  I
                wanted to set my window manager to behave like fvwm (in the
                autopanning sense of the word) when I discovered this.

        Mon Oct 11 09:14:58 PDT 1993 leisner@eso.mc.xerox.com (Marty Leisner)
                Included small patches to Imakefile from Marty Leisner.

        Mon Oct 11 17:04:35 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                NoDefaultTitleButtons
                NoDefaultMouseAndKeyboardBidings
                  so someone could use either the default title or 
                  keyboard bindings, but not necessarily both.

============ vtwm-5.2.2.tar.gz =============

        dsembr01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu (Darren S. Embry)
                used another bug workaround to support negative door
                geometries; the old one I did messed up with positive door
                geometries, especially `+0+0'.

============ vtwm-5.2.1.tar.gz =============

        dsembr01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu (Darren S. Embry)
                AutoPanBorderWidth
                AutoPanExtraWarp
                AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen
                EnhancedExecResources
                LessRandomZoomZoom
                NaturalAutopanBehavior
