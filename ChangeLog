	* Fixed the random color code. Ack.

Tue Sep  7 11:09:31 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at wilma.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Finally got around to adding in the m4 pre-processing of the
	startup file.  Used dme's code. 

Fri Sep  3 10:57:37 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at wilma.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Fixed up the color code to be a bit more reasonable. At least,
	to me, it's more reasonable.  Allows the virtual desktop colors to
	correctly default from the main window colors.

	* Added in ":random" as an internal color name. Generates a random
	supposedly pleasing color. 

	* Added SaveUnders to the Size/Position info window, so that when
	moving underneath that window with Opacity, it isn't too graunchy.

Wed Sep  1 13:06:04 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at mimsy.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Added NoRaiseDesktopOnMove keyword, and made the default
	behaviour raise the desktop at start of move.

Fri Aug 20 14:22:20 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at mimsy.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Fixed bug with add_window not correctly nailing windows. A new
	bug which I had introduced. sigh.

	* removed backingstore from virtual desktop windows. Wasn't
	neccessary with the new move code and caused update problems. at
	least, it did on sun server.

	* Fixed the highlight focus for f.raiselower.

Thu Aug 19 09:49:28 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at mimsy.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* fixed deiconify bug: updatedesktop was called before the icon
	flag in the tmp_win had been corrected.  Optimised some of the
	calls to updatedesktop which I've been adding in
	left/right/center...

Tue Aug 17 10:20:19 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at wilma.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Fixed the redraw of the icon names by removing stupidity code.

Fri Aug 13 11:25:33 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at pebbles.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* BUGS:
	  - f.raiselower does not configure the virtual desktop windows
	  - f.raiselower can lose the focus highlighting
	  - icon names do not get redrawn properly

	* Fixed the add_window code. I had introduced a new bug with
	uposition, now fixed.

	* Re-jigged the UpdateDesktop into many different functions doing
	nice things.  Now things work muchos better.

	* got the new move system actually working. Shock, horror, probe.

Thu Aug 12 13:38:34 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at pebbles.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Picked up tvtwm's move mechanism and incorporated it into the
	vtwm source.  Now you can move in and out of the desktop

Tue Aug 10 13:36:16 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at pebbles.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Fixed snug functions such that they ignore icons.

	* Added DefaultFont and InfoFont keywords, to allow the user to
	override the default font name without having to specify
	everything, and to provide the font to use when giving the info
	window.

	* Changed the version/identify information to be seperate.

	* Fixed DeIconifyToScreen so that it always ensures windows will
	appear at least partially on the real screen.

	* Fixed ConstrainedMove so that the desktop window moves opaquely
	in the correct place (not from 0,0).

Mon Aug  9 14:45:53 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at pebbles.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Added patch from athena: CenteredInfoBox keyword will place the
	resize/position info window into the centre of the screen.

	* Made the desktop display windows have saveunders enabled, so
	that redrawing them doesn't kill your server.

	* Fixed the raising and lowering so it remains consistent inside
	the desktop display.  RaiseLower doesn't work properly tho...

	* Added patch from athena: VirtualDesktop size can be specified as
	multipliers of the real screen. e.g. desktop =3x4.  It works by
	noticing if the first character of the geom string is an '='.

	* BUG: Even when it isn't neccessary, an UpdateDesktop is called.
	As the desktop code can't tell if anything has changed or not, it
	always reconfigures the window, causing the stacking order to go
	bad and other horrid things to happen. Not only that, but it isn't
	called enough! For example, when a window resizes itself (under
	program control), the desktop doesn't notice.

	* Fixed coredump when iconifying doors.  

Fri Aug  6 10:20:14 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at pebbles.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Increased the size of the desktop window to be maxsize, so that
	it's background is correctly filled in. If this isn't done, then
	you can't resize the desktop window later to a larger size,
	without making it look gross.

	* OpaqueResize now handles expose events and so the titlebars get done.

	* TODO:
	  - allow moving of windows into and out of the desktop display
	  - fix OpaqueResize so it redraws the titles

	* Fixed the moving code, so it correctly displays the name and
	position of the window.

	* Changed loads of NULLs to '0' to make gcc happy

	* Fixed the bug in iconification code.

	* Bug in iconification code.  When icon name changes, vtwm
	believes the window has iconified itself and then is severely
	confused with reality.

	* The ctwm stuff merged. Bug still in the moving code.  The m4
	preprocessing hasn't been put in yet. Shall I or shan't I?
	Decisions...

Thu Aug  5 09:56:57 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at pebbles.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Going through merging all of the things from ctwm: 3d menus,
	etc, xpixmaps, seperators in menus.... and more! 

	* Added in the OpaqueResize stuff from ctwm. Oh, for a fast Xserver!

Wed Aug  4 10:20:58 1993  Nick Williams  (njw at pebbles.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* Modified desktop.c so that it always keeps an up-to-date
	property on the root window with the current virtual coordinates
	of the real screen.

	* Added saveunders for desktop windows, so that if you have the
	names written in them, they don't take ages to redraw all the
	time. 

	* Added door_paste_name to doors.c (and handle for using it in
	parse.[ch] and menus.c.  This will grab the current contents of
	the cutbuffer and change the name of the door.

	* Modified desktop.c, events.c, menus.c, parse.c, screen.h, twm.c
	to allow the virtual desktop windows to accept focus, if
	TitleFocus is enabled by user.

	* Updated version.c to indicate hacking in progress!

	* Includes RaiseDelay patch from
		Warren Jessop, University of Washington, whj@cs.washington.edu

	* Includes snug patch from thoth@reef.cis.ufl.edu (Gilligan)

	* includes patch vtwm.5.1.ptch from tar@math.ksu.edu (Tim Ramsey)

	* Includes panner background pixmap, panner foreground color,
		dynamic warpring, dynamic squeezetitle, TWM-Window menu
		colors, RealScreen foreground, background, and colors,
		corrections to placement of the little windows in the
		panner, additional cursors, and maybe a few other things I
		forgot to mention, from me,
		Ralph Betza (gnohmon@ssiny.com)

Tue Mar 24 13:15:11 1992  Dana A. Chee  (dana@dino)

	* fixed problem with key presses in virtual desktop not working
	  (had an if test wrong in events.c)
	* released to export.

Wed Feb 19 13:37:57 1992  Dana A. Chee  (dana at dino)

	* Converted vtwm to use the source of twm from R5 (my base was
	  vtwm 4.0 gamma).  Released it to export.lcs.mit.edu
	* cut and paste missed resize grabs, added them back in
	* botched ask_user stuff in add_window, fixed that up.
	* removed broken copy from export.
