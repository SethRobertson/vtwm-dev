What's in a window manager?
===========================
					Last updated: njw on 1 Sep, 1993.


There are several window managers available nowadays and it has become
pure personal preference for the "look & feel" of a window manager as
to which one you should use.  Here is a summary of the available
window managers with their features.

Twm and its derivatives:
------------------------

* twm:
	This is the vanilla flavour. Providing no especially fancy
	features, with rather a plain, but distinctive look&feel.
	Written	originally by Tom LaStrange, later hacked by everyone.
	Current version: 5.0 (sync'd with the X11 release number).
	Availability:  X11 contrib tape

* vtwm:
	The virtual version of twm.  This adds a "virtual desktop"
	concept to twm, allowing the user to place windows anywhere on
	the desktop and then viewing only part of the desktop.  The
	desktop is implemented by keeping note of the virtual
	coordinates of all the windows and moving/mapping/unmapping
	windows as the viewing position changes.  The root window of
	the display is unaffected by vtwm.  Originally carved into
	shape by Dave Edmondson and later hacked by everyone who didn't
	play with the original twm. Also features 3D appearance and
	color XPM icons, courtesy of Claude Lecommandeur (ctwm author).
	Current version: 5.2 (major number sync'd with the X11 release)
	Availability:  X11 contrib ftp-site

* tvtwm:
	Another version of twm with a virtual desktop, done by
	Tom LaStrange.  This version is implemented by creating an
	X window which is the desktop and then just moving the viewing 
	position of the window.  This means that compared to vtwm:

		- the root window is obscured by the desktop window
		  and so programs which attempt to modify the root
		  window need to be modified to look at the desktop
		  window instead.

		- the communication between twm and the Xserver is
		  less as twm only needs to move the desktop window
		  and the server can figure out the rest. Also makes 
		  it faster.
	Current version: Revision 10.0
	Availability:  X11 contrib ftp-site

* ctwm:
	This adds rooms to twm, categorised by occupation.  Windows
	can switch rooms when they change their occupation, or be in
	multiple rooms simultaneously.  Comes with a programming
	library to communicate with the window manager about occupations
	and rooms...
	Also features 3D appearance and allows color XPM icons.
	Current version: 3.0
	Availability:  X11 contrib ftp-site

* piewm:
	This provides circular menus onto vanilla twm, which are
	supposedly easier to use.
	Availability:  X11 contrib ftp-site


Other window managers
---------------------

* olvwm:
	The Open Look Virtual Window Manager. Phew. Title says it all
	really.
	Current version: 3 + patchlevel 3
	Availability:  X11 contrib ftp-site
	
* gwm:
	The generic window manager.  This is the emacs of the window
	managers. Yes, it's a lisp interpreter. Very very customisable 
	but a bit slow. Can be made to look like twm or mwm easily.
	Why you'd want to...
	Current version: 1.7o-beta3 (ick!)
	Availability:  X11 contrib ftp-site

* swm:
	The solbourne window manager, written by Tom LaStrange. 
	This is proprietry to Solbourne.  It has a virtual desktop 
	facility; tvtwm and swm share many features.

* mwm:
	The motif window manager.  Very distinctive look and feel.
	Considered clunky and slow by some.  Some feel it looks flash.
	Oh well.  The configuration of mwm is done largely by X
	resources, which is quite nice. maybe.
	Availability: Comes with motif.
