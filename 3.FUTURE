NOW IT'S *YOUR* TURN!
=====================

    With this version I'm gonna quit for a while as the semester is just
    about to start and I *probably* won't have enough time to fool with vtwm
    anymore.  If you're willing to work on the next version, just send me
    email and I'll forward any mail I get concerning vtwm to you.  I had
    some real fun working with this thing. --- DSE
