A FEW THOUGHTS TO FUTURE MAINTAINERS/DEVELOPERS/HACKERS
=======================================================

  - If you feel compelled to add more compile-time options (i.e., Java
    support, etc.), please follow the "NO_" and "NEED_" conventions in the
    make files. Also, add code as appropriate to menus.c:Identify() and
    parse.c:make_m4_cmdline().

  - Likewise, please follow what few coding conventions are in place. Don't
    use C++'s double-slash comments, keep up with the K&R style functions,
    etc.

  - Keep VTWM portable. There are only two "#ifdef __PLATFORM__"s in this
    code, yet it runs on platforms I've never seen. GNU isn't everywhere.
    Neither is POSIX or ANSI. Seek out variety through beta-testers in the
    X-related newsgroups. Finally, remember that it's X11R4 compliant.

  - Just because you can't live without such-and-such doesn't mean everyone
    can't. It's a window manager, not an environment. Help keep VTWM lean.

  - Add no memory leaks! I haven't read every line of this code, but have
    had to fix very few, and have seen that none have been introduced.
    'Nuff said 'bout that.

  - Document! The code is a long commentary on VTWM's evolution, and though
    it does get hard to read, I've come to think it a Good Thing. Keep the
    files in the in the doc directory current.

Sorry if this reads a little belligerent. I'm just tired of fighting all
sorts of platform-specific implementations and lazy coding practices while
porting stuff. I'm sure you are too. VTWM should never be such. --- djhjr
