This package is a rough-and-ready way to maintain
a .twmrc, .tvtwmrc, or .vtwmrc file.

The Problem:
============

The colorlists in .twmrc, .tvtwmrc, or .vtwmrc are tedious to
maintain.

I mostly use a predefined set of xterm windows, and want them to
have their actual foreground and background colors in the virtual
desktop display, in the icon manager, and in the "TwmWindows" menu.
In fact, I look for the *color*, not the *name*, when I choose one
from the panner or from a menu.

At first, I had a lot of scripts to start these windows, one script
per window.

The Solution:
=============

I came up with the idea of having a shell database of these windows,
so that I could do two things: first, make a script to start a
window, and second, devise a way to automatically update my .vtwmrc
file.

The enclosed is not fancy; it is intended to be adapted
to your needs by hacking at the files.

You don't want to use it as is; you need to make your own
vtwmrc.proto, and your own database files. Other than that, it's
ready to use, and easy to understand; you don't need perl or
anything else fancy, and you don't have to learn any new languages.

Please, no complaints about grunginess.
There are obviously many aesthetic defects.
The main constraint on the development of this package was that I
wanted to get it done without wasting a lot of time on it!

The Missing Parts:
==================

Files needed only for running Xterm on remote machines are not
included. They would only clutter this up and make it harder to
understand, and I don't use them any more, so they're out of date.

Database files are not included. My window names are different than
yours.
