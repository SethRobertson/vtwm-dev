A LISTING OF BUGS
=================

This appears to be a list of bugs created as a result of addressing a
particular facet of VTWM, as I "inherited" many more than this. --- djhjr

  * Windows don't resize correctly when resize is called from a menu; you
    have to use a keybinding to resize it, i.e., 
    'Button2 = m : window | frame : resize' --- DSE

  * Behavior of transients on the virtual desktop, when the real screen is
    not at (0,0), is almost unpredictable.  Hence the
    FixTransientVirtualGeometries variable, new to 5.3, which is not
    guaranteed to work in every case. --- DSE

This is a list of bugs created as a result of my addressing a particular
facet of VTWM. --- djhjr

  * Icon borders will not do 3D, and I don't want to to mess with it.
    The icons themselves are 3D when IconBevelWidth is non-zero, however,
    and the IconBorderWidth variable is automatically set to 0. --- djhjr

  * The code to vertically center a door name in the window is correct.
    It just won't appear so, due to the window and font heights. Play with
    the door geometry. --- djhjr

  * Something is corrupting titlebutton names, or TBWindow structures
    aren't properly handled? A trap is hacked in. --- djhjr

  * Behavior of managed windows when used as transients on the virtual
    desktop, when the real screen is not at (0,0), is sometimes flawed.
    Hence the FixManagedVirtualGeometries variable, new to 5.4.4, which
    is also guaranteed to not work in every case. --- djhjr

  * When the WarpCursor variable is set, but the WarpWindows variable is
    not: The screen warp to de-iconifying windows not on the real screen
    is unpredictable at best. A kludge is in that fixes it. --- djhjr

  * The BeNiceToColormap variable does, but the rendition isn't perfect.
    My Tuit isn't round enough yet. --- djhjr

  * External images for titlebar buttons and the highlight bar aren't
    scaled to or centered in their windows. --- djhjr

  * When the VirtualSendsMotionEvents and OpaqueMove variables are set:
    While moving an application window in the virtual desktop, the border
    of the corresponding real screen window doesn't highlight. --- djhjr

  * When 3D bevel widths reach double digits, things start going weird,
    and I don't know why. Hence an imposed limit of nine pixels. --- djhjr

  * The sample resource file .vtwmrc-marcel is quite out of date regarding
    the various VTWM capabilities since I started playing. --- djhjr

This is a list of bugs encountered and not fixed while addressing a
particular facet of VTWM. There are likely many more than this. --- djhjr

  * Move and resize from a menu not belonging to the window in question
    don't behave the same; This may be just a clarification of DSE's
    first bug. --- djhjr

  * Windows won't move correctly when move is called from a menu in the
    icon manager; This may also be a clarification of DSE's first bug.
    --- djhjr

  * The behavior of the virtual desktop window will be less than perfect
    if its dimensions as specified do not work out to exact whole numbers.
    --- djhjr

  * There are precious few safeguards against binding functions to objects
    inappropriately, particularly where the virtual desktop is concerned.
    --- djhjr

  * The cursor doesn't know what to revert to after deleting a door, so it
    goes "wait" until a button is pressed. --- djhjr

  * Redefining a function, bound to a context, doesn't behave as one would
    expect... really strange things occur. --- djhjr
