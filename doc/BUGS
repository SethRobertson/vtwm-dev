A LISTING OF BUGS
=================

This is the bug list as distributed with VTWM 5.3.

  * Behavior of transients on the virtual desktop, when the real screen is
    not at (0,0), is almost unpredictable.  Hence the
    FixTransientVirtualGeometries variable, new to 5.3, which is not
    guaranteed to work in every case. --- DSE

  * When the Zoom count is a largish number and PrettyZoom is set, some
    artifacts may be left on formerly obscured windows. Decrease the count
    value. --- djhjr

  * Not a bug, but the IconRegion variable should take a list. --- DSE

  * Not a bug, but the resource manager should have been used instead of
    all of the window lists. --- DSE

Bugs created as a result of my hacking VTWM 5.4. --- djhjr

  * Icon borders will not do 3D, and I don't want to to mess with it.
    The icons themselves are 3D when IconBevelWidth is non-zero, however,
    and the IconBorderWidth variable is automatically set to 0.

  * The code to vertically center a door name in the window is correct.
    It just won't appear so, due to the window and font heights. Play with
    the door geometry.

  * Behavior of managed windows when used as transients on the virtual
    desktop, when the real screen is not at (0,0), is sometimes flawed.
    Hence the FixManagedVirtualGeometries variable, new to 5.4.4, which
    is also guaranteed to not work in every case.

  * Only titlebar buttons, and therefore the titlebar itself, can adjust
    to the height of external images.

  * All images should either tile or center as required.

  * VTWM recognizes two-color pixmaps, but incorrectly uses them as
    bitmaps.

  * When 3D bevel widths reach double digits, things start going weird,
    and I don't know why. Hence an imposed limit of nine pixels.

  * The region resources don't like 0 or 1 for a horizontal grid space.
    A kludge is in that fixes it (I think).

  * The f.warpto function doesn't recognize a regular expression.

  * It is possible to place a window sufficiently off-screen as to defeat
    warp functions (ex: The visible part wholly within AutoPanBorderWidth
    pixels of screen edge).

  * When warping the screen to a window during a move or resize operation,
    any number of exposed clients may not get drawn.

  * Menus can become unresponsive. I don't know what triggers this, though
    submenu selections seem to be involved.

  * At least one application seems to foul up the window ring. At present,
    restarting VTWM is the only cure.

Bugs encountered and not fixed while hacking VTWM 5.4. --- djhjr

  * Opaque resizing of windows with squeezed titlebars can kill the X
    server. A hack prevents this by raising the window before the resize.

  * If there is an order of precedence regarding contexts, it's broken.

  * There are precious few safeguards against binding functions to objects
    inappropriately, particularly where the virtual desktop is concerned.

  * Redefining a bound function doesn't behave as one would expect; really
    strange things occur.

  * Not a bug, but the sample resource file .vtwmrc-marcel is quite out
    of date regarding various VTWM features.
