BUILDING VTWM-5.4.N
===================

  - Unpack the distribution. You've likely done that already.

  - Determine if you have the XPM library installed:
      - The library is usually found in /usr/X11/lib, /usr/local/lib,
        or some such directory. It's usually called "libxpm.a".
      - The header file is usually found in /usr/X11/include,
        /usr/local/include, or some such directory. It's "xpm.h".

  - Look over the Imakefile, and edit to taste.

  - Issue 'xmkmf'. If that doesn't work (you'll know it), you'll
    have to copy Makefile.QNX to Makefile, and edit the latter
    to taste.

  - Issue 'make'. While it's building, read the man page. Start
    building up your $(HOME)/.vtwmrc. If the build breaks, check
    further down in this file, and retry. If it still breaks, ask
    a friend. If it _still_ breaks, write me.


INSTALLING VTWM-5.4.N
=====================

  - If you trust whoever set up your build environment:
      - As root, issue 'make install' and 'make install.man'.
    If you don't:
      - Issue 'make -n install' and 'make -n install.man' to see
        what it'll do, without actually doing it.
    If you want (or have) to set it up manually:
      - As root, copy vtwm to /usr/X11/bin, or to wherever other X
        window managers and binaries are.
      - As root, copy system.vtwmrc to wherever it's spec'd in the
        Makefile (this path is built into the VTWM binary).
      - As root, copy vtwm.man to wherever other X window manager
        man pages are (usually /usr/man/mann).

  - Edit the script that starts your current X window manager to
    start VTWM (mine is 'vtwm -display :0.0' in $(HOME)/.xinitrc).

  - Exit X, and restart it.


BUILD HINTS
===========

  - If, during the build, you get complaints of an undefined "yylineno",
    remove the "extern" keyword from the declaration in gram.y. Likewise,
    if "yywrap" turns up as undefined, add a line "yywrap() {return(1)};"
    to lex.l. They're both expected to be defined and initialized in the
    [f]lex skeleton file, but some systems seem to choke on these.

  - If, during the build, you get complaints of undefined data types and
    functions "Xpm" whatall, it's because you've built VTWM with XPM image
    support and either you don't have the XPM library available, or it's
    not a recent enough version (3.4h is the earliest I know of). Read the
    comments in Imakefile and/or Makefile.QNX.

  - If, during the build, you get complaints of an unknown data type
    "Pixel", add "EXTRA_DEFINES=-DNEED_PIXEL_T" to the make command.

  - If you expected HTML or Postscript man pages on build completion,
    or VTWM doesn't fall back on system resource files on startup, read
    the comments in Imakefile and/or Makefile.QNX.


RUNTIME HINTS
=============

  - If you use any of the 3D resources from versions before 5.4.5, you
    will find that they generate errors on startup. They no longer exist!
    See the man page or the CHANGELOG file for the new resources (look
    for the word "Bevel").

  - If you use a SqueezeTitle list from versions before 5.4.4, you may
    want to check the man page to see if the new enterpretation of the
    resource's list parameters fouls your setup.

  - It's mentioned all over the place, but bears repeating: The virtual
    desktop just won't behave correctly if its geometries don't work out
    to whole-number ratios of both itself and the physical display as
    measured in pixels.

  - See also the BUGS file.
