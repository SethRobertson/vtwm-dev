hawkeyd@visi.com (D. J. Hawkey Jr. aka djhjr)

    September 27, 1998
        [menus.c] [resize.c]

            From Goran Larsson (hoh@lorelei.approve.se)
                Fixed text display bug in the size and position windows.

        VTWM 5.4.5a released for public consumption.
        vtwm-5.4.5-to-5.4.5a.txt patch file released.

    September 14, 1998
        Established a directory, doc, for all the documentation
        that has accumulated through time. The HINTS file is now
        called INSTALL, and is more comprehensive.

        [util.c]
            The menu, resize and X logo built-in bitmaps now account
            for the ButtonBevelWidth variable.

    September 8 - 10, 1998
        [events.c] [iconmgr.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h]
            Fixed a bug with icon manager geometries that would blow
            VTWM out of the water. Added code to make it a little
            harder to accidentally pan to an adjacent virtual screen.

            Added the following variable:
                PanResistance n

    September 4 - 5, 1998
        [events.c] [menus.c] [resize.c] [resize.h]
            Fixed another pixmap oversight, this one for icons,
            noted by C. F. Jalali. Applied the MoveDelta variable
            to window resizing and initial menu highlighting.

            From Steve Ratcliffe (sterat@dial.pipex.com);
                Fixed a bug for the AutoPan variable, when the pan
                windows are obscured by a newly-raised window.

    September 2, 1998
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [util.c] [util.h]
            Plugged a memory leak, as noted by Jason Gloudon, where
            transparent pixmap resources weren't freed before re-use.

    August 23 - 27, 1998
        [add_window] [events.c] [icons.c] [menus.c] [parse.c]
        [twm.c] [util.c]
            Fixed a bug where the titlebar highlight wasn't
            erased when focus was unset and the BeNiceToColormap
            and SunkFocusWindowTitle variables were used.

            From Steve Ratcliffe (sterat@dial.pipex.com):
                Tweaks to suppress menu highlighting on mapping,
                relieve CPU consumption on menus bound to rodent
                buttons, and allow a second rodent button press to
                cancel menus. A safer approach to the RaiseDelay
                variable's timeout.

            From Jason Gloudon (jgloudon@bbn.com):
                Tweaks to streamline icon bitmap handling, and
                fixed the painting of non-transparent titlebar
                highlight pixmaps.

            From Caveh Frank Jalali (caveh@eng.sun.com):
                Fixed a bug I introduced where non-3D borders were
                always rendered as highlighted! Tweaks to correct
                the painting of built-in images on multiple screens.
                Fixed some bugs in colormap management. Tweaks for
                application-defined icon border widths.

    August 10 - 14, 1998
        All references to and mention of the shadow contrast and
        shadow width variables have been changed to *BevelContrast
        and *BevelWidth.

        [add_window.c] [doors.c] [events.c] [iconmgr.c] [icons.c]
        [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [screen.h]
            Fixed an oversight, color (XPM) image support for the
            UnknownIcon variable and application-specified icons.
            Window buttons are now beveled when external images are
            used. The *BevelWidth variables render the UseThreeD*
            variables obsolete. The ThreeDBorderWidth variable is
            superfluous, too, no?

            Removed the following variables:
                UseThreeDBorders
                UseThreeDIcons
                UseThreeDIconManagers
                UseThreeDMenus
                UseThreeDTitles
                ThreeDBorderWidth n

            Added the following variables:
                ButtonBevelWidth n
                IconBevelWidth n

            Changed the following variable:
                UnknownIcon s

    July 31 & August 3, 1998
        Discovered that VTWM supports a subset of regex wildcards for
        list variables! It's in the man page now.

        [events.c] [menus.c] [twm.c] [twm.h]
            Another tweak to the f.warpclass* functions, to properly
            handle multiple icon managers. Added a signal handler for
            external restarts (adapted from TVTWM pl11).

    July 15 - 17, 1998
        [desktop.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c] [parse.h]
            Added code to restart using a specified window manager.
            A few changes to grab the server during non-opaque moves
            and resizes, regardless of the NoGrabServer variable.

            Added the following function:
                f.startwm s

    July 2 & 14, 1998
        [events.c]
            Made the borders of windows without titlebars forward key
            events to the application, like titlebars do. I think the
            various warps from icon managers are sorted out now.

    June 25, 1998
        [gram.y] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h]
            Aliased a new variable, OldFashionedVtwmWindowsMenu, to the
            OldFashionedTwmWindowsMenu variable, just for consistancy.

            From Erik Agsjo (erik.agsjo@aktiedirekt.com)
                Added code to support two new variable(s).

            Added the following variables:
                DontShowInTwmWindows l
                DontShowInVtwmWindows l
                OldFashionedVtwmWindowsMenu

    June 10 - 15, 1998
        [events.c] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c]
            Had to make an exception for icon managers regarding warps,
            that their window border isn't the destination, because I
            can't figure out how to make the appropriate entry active
            when one isn't without screwing up something else. BAH! Added
            a few "prevents" when there isn't an icon manager mapped. The
            f.warpclass* functions now behave correctly when an empty
            string is used on windows without titlebars or on VTWM-specific
            windows.

    June 3 - 6, 1998
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [events.c] [menus.c] [resize.c]
            Made initial window placement adjust to client borderwidths,
            depending on related variables. The virtual desktop is now
            re-mapped after non-opaque moves and resizes to clean up any
            outline droppings left on it when the Virtual*MotionEvents
            variables are set. The window border of the virtual desktop
            now honors key bindings to "virtual". Doors and their borders
            are now sensitive to key bindings, too.

    May 27, 1998
        [events.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h]
            Added code to not set focus from icon manager entries to
            the corresponding application windows, for binding keys that
            otherwise would get forwarded.

            Added the following variable:
                NoIconManagerFocus

    May 24, 1998
        Established a directory, lnf (look n' feel), for the previously
        included sample resource and image files, and added a couple
        more to it. Renamed some files: marcel.vtwm to .vtwmrc-marcel,
        djhjr.vtwmrc to .vtwmrc-95ish, djhjr.vtwmpm to djhjr.xpm,
        realscr.bm to nestedsqu.xbm, and siconify.bm to siconify.xbm.

        [iconmgr.c] [util.c]
            Changed to handle the above.

    May 17 - 23, 1998
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c] [twm.c] [util.c]
        [screen.h] [util.h]
            Found and plugged the hole in the original menu handler that
            would blow VTWM out of the water when the pointer scrolled
            down past the last entry. Gave the icon manager and virtual
            desktop resource classes. The f.warpclass* functions will now
            exhibit reasonable behavior when an empty string is used on
            windows without titlebars or on VTWM-specific windows. The
            three entries of the Pixmaps variable now fully support color
            (XPM) images - this does render the nexpm utility obsolete in
            regard to VTWM, but it's still included in the distribution.
            The external image support for window buttons is better, but
            still not perfect (see BUGS).

            Changed the following variable:
                Pixmaps l

    May 11 - 13, 1998
        [add_window.c] [events.c] [menus.c] [twm.h]
            The f.warpclassprev and f.warpclassnext functions now accept
            an empty string, meaning the class of the window with focus,
            and the first actually goes backwards now! Tweaks made to those
            and the f.warpring function so its destination is a titlebar or
            border like the other warp functions, and it now remembers the
            window to warp to when invoked from the root window, unless the
            target window was unmapped (leaving the pointer on the root
            window), in which case it will no longer skip the first window
            in the ring. All warping functions now honor the WarpUnmapped
            variable a la the f.warpto function.

            Changed the following functions:
                f.warpclassprev s
                f.warpclassnext s
                f.warpnewest
                f.warpring s
                f.warptoiconmgr s

    April 26 - May 5, 1998
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [events.c] [gram.y] [iconmgr.c]
        [icons.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c] [twm.c] [util.c]
        [menus.h] [screen.h] [twm.h]
            The 3D rendition of icons is now governed by its own variable.
            The 3D bevel widths are configurable now, and related elements
            are sized and positioned accordingly. Virtual window geometries
            now account for 3D borders. Virtual-to-real window scaling and
            positioning errors have been reduced. The position window now
            reports during moves in the virtual desktop. Re-instated the
            effects of the RightHandSidePulldownMenus variable! Changed the
            foreground color for the built-in "TwmWindows" menu to that of
            the global variable, and aliased it's name to "VTWM Windows",
            just for consistancy's sake.

            Added the following variables:
                UseThreeDIcons
                BorderBevelWidth n
                IconManagerBevelWidth n
                InfoBevelWidth n
                MenuBevelWidth n
                TitleBevelWidth n

            From Nelson H. F. Beebe (beebe@math.utah.edu):
                Even more tweaks for portability, most notably, restoring
                X11R4 compatability by not including the X11R5,6 headers
                Xosdefs.h and Xfuncs.h! X11R5,6 don't seem to mind.

    April 20 - 23, 1998
        [nexpm/nexpm.c]

            From Steve Ratcliffe (sterat@dial.pipex.com):
                Added a test for the child window of the selected window.

        [*akefile*] [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [doors.c] [events.c]
        [lex.l] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [doors.h] [parse.h]
            Purged GNU-specific syntax from this new Imakefile, and changed
            the NO_PUTENV definition to NEED_PUTENV_F, for consistancy.
            Added code to support pasting a name into a door (adapted from
            VTWM 5.2b).

            Added the following function:
                f.namedoor

            From Steve Ratcliffe (sterat@dial.pipex.com):
                Many tweaks made in the name of Portability. The snug
                variables now take border width into account.

            From Nelson H. F. Beebe (beebe@math.utah.edu):
                Many more tweaks for portability's sake.

    April 14 - 17, 1998
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c]
        [twm.c] [resize.h] [screen.h]
            When windows are created, they now honor the opaque variables
            when the RandomPlacement variable is not set. While moving and
            resizing windows on the real screen, the virtual desktop now
            responds in kind, and visa-versa. The NoGrabServer variable now
            sees to it the server is actually not grabbed! The position
            window now reports during constrained moves.

            Added the following variables:
                VirtualReceivesMotionEvents
                VirtualSendsMotionEvents

    April 1 - 8, 1998
        [*akefile*] [system.vtwmrc*] [add_window.c] [gram.y] [menus.c]
        [parse.c] [resize.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [screen.h] [twm.h] [util.h]
            Added a define supporting a 2D or 3D system default resource
            file, and made that file a bit more useful. Added code for
            opaque resizing, and all opaque variables now support lists.
            Many tweaks to make titlebar-related variables consistant with
            respect to each other and 3D rendition of the various elements.

            Added the following variables:
                OpaqueResize [l]
                NoOpaqueResize [l]
                NoOpaqueMove [l]

            Changed the following variable:
                OpaqueMove [l]

   March 29 - 30, 1998
        [Imakefile] [events.c] [util.c]
            Added the system Imake.tmpl macro for flex's library (should
            be absent or an empty string on systems with lex). Added code
            to properly truncate, then add ellipses to, titles that are
            longer than the space they're drawn on.

    March 23 - 24, 1998
        [gram.y] [util.c] [version.c]
            Fixed the rendition of a squeezed titlebar's right-side 3D
            border (a silly gunkulation error).

            From Jason Gloudon (jgloudon@bbn.com):
                Support for bison.

    March 20 - 22, 1998
        [add_window.c] [util.c] [version.c]
            Added color image (XPM) support for window buttons. Jason's
            code for color icon images made it a breeze, but it's not
            perfect (see BUGS).

        VTWM 5.4.4c released for public consumption.
        vtwm-5.4.4b-to-5.4.4c.txt patch file released.

    March 14 - 15, 1998
        [events.c] [menus.c] [version.c]
            Fixed a bug where the window buttons would get painted with
            the border color when the background color should have been
            used.

            From Steve Ratcliffe (sterat@dial.pipex.com):
                Fixed warping to titlebars not flush left.

        VTWM 5.4.4b released for public consumption.
        vtwm-5.4.4a-to-5.4.4b.txt patch file released.

    February 5, 1998
        [*akefile*] [events.c] [menus.c] [util.c] [version.c]
            Tweaks to accomodate the following made to the *akefile*s.

            From Takeharu Kato (magician@maekawa.is.uec.ac.jp):
                Fixed a fault causing a SIGSEGV in the info window,
                and the use of a depreciated constant in the XPM library.

        VTWM 5.4.4a released for public consumption.
        vtwm-5.4.4-to-5.4.4a.txt patch file released.

    February 2, 1998
        VTWM 5.4.4 released for public consumption.

    January 27, 1998
        [add_window.c] [iconmgr.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h] [gram.y]
            Added a variable to tell the icon manager whether or not to
            highlight its entries as an indication of pointer location,
            regardless of the NoHighlight variable.

            Added the following variable:
                NoIconManagerHighlight

            From Nicholas Jacobs (nicholas_jacobs@hotmail.com):
                A better effort at getting a name for the window.

    January 24, 1998
        [desktop.c] [menus.c]
            Allow screen warps to honor the SnapRealScreen variable.
            Added a kludge to "fix" screen warps to de-iconifying windows
            not on the real screen (high degree of confidence it's not the
            source of the problem).

    January 21, 1998
        Added the HINTS file to the distribution. Moved and added many
        function declarations into header files (quieter builds!). Other
        miscellaneous tweaks.

    December 28, 1997, January 1 - 19, 1998
        [nexpm/nexpm.c]
            Changed the window name sought by `nexpm -vtwm ...` to match
            the virtual desktop's name. It's a wonder nobody's noticed!

        [*akefile*] [add_window.c] [cursor.c] [desktop.c] [doors.c]
        [events.c] [gc.c] [icons.c] [list.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c]
        [twm.c] [util.c] [util.h] [version.c] [screen.h] [gram.y]
            Rewrote most of the 3D border code, adding, among other things,
            drawing the top border segment when 3D borders are used with
            squeezed titles! Simplified the meaning of the SqueezeTitle
            variable list parameters. Fixed a bug causing SIGFPEs when pan
            distances are set to zero. Added a bug workaround to try to
            make managed windows used as transients behave, a la the
            FixTransientVirtualGeometries variable (seldom needed, just as
            bad, but mostly works). Fixed an oversight of mine, not
            initializing monochrome GCs! Enabled a variable to go easy on
            the colormap (doesn't render perfectly yet). Use the system
            Imake.tmpl macro for yacc and removed all escaped characters
            from the lastmake.c rule in the *akefile*s. Clarified the pan
            distance variable descriptions in the man page.

            Added the following variables:
                BeNiceToColormap
                FixManagedVirtualGeometries

            From Nelson H. F. Beebe (beebe@math.utah.edu):
                On startup, VTWM now searches for user and system .vtwmrc
                files, then user and system .twmrc files, in this order.
                Fixed and added many declarations and definitions. Updated
                the man page. Support for HTML and Postscript versions of
                the man page added to the *akefile*s. 

            From Jason Gloudon (jgloudon@bbn.com):
                Color image (XPM) support for icons.

        Added a pixmap (djhjr.vtwmpm) referenced in my resource file
        (djhjr.vtwmrc) for an example of the nexpm utility.

        Pruned the R4 Imakefile from the tree.

        Pruned the vtwmrc/ directory from the distribution tree. No offense
        to Mr. Betza, but it made little sense (to me), was five years old,
        was very esoteric, and anyone who wants it probably already has it.

    November 17, 1997
        VTWM 5.4.3 released for public consumption.

    November 17 - 19, 1997
        [events.c] [menus.c] [util.c] [util.h]
            Fixed a bug where the wrong variable was being used to
            highlight the window border that has focus. Fixed an omission
            where the window buttons would not follow the border color
            when highlighted and the ButtonColorIsFrame variable is true.
            Added a hack to trap corrupted/invalid window button names.

    October 27, 1997
        VTWM 5.4.2 released for public consumption.

    March 12 - 14, 1997
        [add_window.c] [menus.c] [twm.c] [util.c]
            Added code to properly paint the window buttons in the same
            color as their titlebar on a restart operation. Woo-woo!
            Numerous changes to accomodate added buttons and squeezed
            titlebars - I had previously overlooked these. Made a few
            variables un-alterable when 3D appearances are used. Now
            closes the display before spawning the new WM on a restart
            operation - free alloc'd memory in the X server?

    September 25 - 26, 1996
        [menus.c]
            Changed code to properly scale menus to the fonts used.

    September 14 - 21, 1996
        [add_window.c] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c] [resize.c] [twm.h] [util.c]
        [version.h] [*akefil*] [vtwm.man]
            Fixed a bug in zooms that I introduced! Applied the backing
            store and NoBackingStore variables to the Icon Manager and
            titlebars (defeats effects of RaiseDelay). Made the cursor
            warp to the titlebar on a zoom operation if WarpCursor is
            set on. The function f.showdesktopdisplay now deiconifies as
            required. Working on code to make the window buttons stay the
            same color as their titlebar on a restart operation (obviously
            wasn't thought about much before). Added build info to the
            Version window by having the *makefil*s create a temporary C
            module.

            Added the following variable:
                ButtonColorIsFrame

    September 10 - 12, 1996
        [events.c] [menus.c]
            Added code preventing the virtual desktop window and Door
            windows from doing harm. Fixed a bug when trying to move the
            virtual desktop window with the pointer; see the notes in
            djhjr.vtwmrc pertaining to the virtual desktop, it's related,
            and the BUGS file.

    June 26, 1996
        [screen.h] [parse.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [vtwm.man]
            Tweaked the 3D menu icons to look a little more like menus.
            Made the 3D Icon Manager iconified indicators "shallow" to
            match the 3D menu icons. Added code for Motif-ish "shallow"
            relief in 3D titlebars and buttons to matches the others.

            Added the following variable:
                ShallowReliefWindowButton

    June 11, 1996
        [icons.c] [events.c]
            Tweaked the hard-coded geometries for a better 3D appearance
            on icons (looks best with IconBorderWidth set to 0).

    April 18 - May 19, 1996
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [doors.c] [doors.h] [events.c]
        [gram.y] [iconmgr.c] [iconmgr.h] [icons.c] [menus.c] [menus.h]
        [parse.c] [resize.c] [screen.h] [twm.c] [twm.h] [util.c] [util.h]
        [version.c]
            Modifications and/or additions to the above modules for
            a 3D appearance, menu separators, a position window, info
            window fonts, resize/position window locations, and other
            minor tweaks (listed below). All should be initialled and
            dated. Changed as many as convenient boolean shorts to bits in
            a Slim-Fast effort (the only executable code changed was due
            to renaming the variable SnapRealScreen to snapRealScreen; the
            shorts maybe reinstated with '#define ORIGINAL_SHORTS').
            Changed "Twm Door" to "VTWM Door", in the name of Consistancy.
            Changed "Virtual Desktop" to "VTWM Desktop". Ditto. Changed the
            code to center Door names in their windows. It *is* correct,
            but only looks more correct. Took liberties with the
            SunkFocusWindowTitle function. I think it more pleasing. Took
            liberties with other code too, look for '#ifdef ORIGINAL_'.
            A couple of changes for a cleaner compile (what were 'int'
            functions are now 'void', etc.). Rem'd out code no longer
            valid due to these changes.

            Added the following variables:
                SunkFocusWindowTitle
                UseThreeDIconManagers
                UseThreeDMenus
                UseThreeDTitles
                UseThreeDBorders
                ThreeDBorderWidth n
                ClearBevelContrast n
                DarkBevelContrast n
                InfoFont s
                ResizeRegion s

            Added the following function:
                f.separator

        Updated the man page.
        Included my .vtwmrc (djhjr.vtwmrc) in this distribution.

                [menus.c] Autopanned windows are now raised when Autopan is

                [desktop.c] Small bug fix regarding representations of
                nailed windows on the virtual desktop; it was obvious and
                obviously unintentional.

        Sun Oct 24 16:16:52 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                f.lower now won't lower the window if it is nailed down and
                StickyAbove is set.

        Tue Oct 19 18:03:35 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                StickyAbove (I didn't take any of the code for this from
                tvtwm; just the idea.)

        Mon Oct 18 21:14:04 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Fixed autopanning bug that would *sometimes* not allow
                AutoPan to work if the focus was on a window, since 
                the autopan windows (on the edges of the real screen)
                weren't raised.

        Sat Oct 16 18:23:43 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Nailed windows now *always* go on the real screen, wherever
                the real screen is.

        Wed Oct 13 12:21:54 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Aliased "f.stick" to "f.nail", for greater compatibility
                (or less incompatibility) between .vtwmrc and .tvtwmrc,
                just for the hell of it.

        Mon Oct 11 21:06:09 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Fixed a bug that would make the window manager mess up if
                "AutoPan 100" and "AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen 100"
                (a.k.a. "NaturalAutoPanBehavior") were set.  I wanted to
                set my window manager to behave like fvwm (in the
                autopanning sense of the word) when I discovered this.

                Included small patches to Imakefile from Marty Leisner.

                NoDefaultTitleButtons
                NoDefaultMouseAndKeyboardBindings
                so someone could use either the default title or 
                keyboard bindings, but not necessarily both.
