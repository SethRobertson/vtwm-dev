A COMPLETE LISTING OF CHANGES MADE TO VTWM SINCE VERSION 5.0
IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER FROM MOST RECENT CHANGES TO EARLIEST.
============================================================

    Jan 2008
	Eeri Kask submitted 9 sets of patches with the following
	functionality/fixes:
	    * patchset 0 - remove the NO_I18N_SUPPORT compiler directive.
		This is now handled in the code.

	    * patchset 1 - GC changes/cleanup.

	    * patchset 2 - Introduce MyWindow data structure to manage upcoming
		Xft support.

	    * patchset 3 - libXft font rendering (when supported by server).

	    * patchset 4 - Interline spacing dependent upon font height. This
		is selected with a compile time flag TWM_USE_SPACING in the
		Imakefile.

	    * patchset 5 - Opacity support for vtwm menus, icons and icon
	       	manager. This is enabled with TWM_USE_OPACITY, and requires
		the use of xcompmgr (see freedesktop.org).

	    * patchset 6 - Various fixes:
		(a) If MenuTitleFont was .vtwmrc-specified or not was
		tested by checking if Scr->MenuTitleFont.name is NULL,
		most notably in menus.c.  To avoid these runtime tests
		MenuTitleFont.name is set to MenuFont.name in CreateFonts()
		in twm.c prior to loading, if not already set in .vtwmrc
		(otherwise GetFont() was called with NULL name and caused
		Xft crash).

		(b) Don't warp mouse to another screen if executing some
		functions under XGrabPointer().  Window move, resize
		operations (maybe others?) need forced staying on the
		screen of function execution though.  (See
		ExecuteFunction() in menus.c)

		(c) Don't unhighlight iconmanager client label if entering
		another screen in HandleEnterNotify() in events.c, it
		is already unhighlighted and only causes an X11-protocol
		error while drawing with a GC of a wrong screen.

		(d) SetFocus() in util.c lacks 'Scr' null-pointer test
		in TRACE-enclosed code (affected are notably f.quit,
		f.restart).

	    * patchset 7 - SloppyFocus feature. This needs to be enabled
		with TWM_USE_SLOPPYFOCUS in addition to a vtwmrc setting.

	    * patchset 8 - Modifications to warp behaviour.
		+ Warp cursor into new client windows as per the same rules
		as deiconifying.
		+ Warp transients only to current client windows. As this
		is not backward compatible it will be subsequently modified
		to provide a range of behaviours controlled in vtwmrc.

	    * patchset 9 - Various appearance changes:
		(a) SizeWindow, InfoWindow, menu border width tied to
		'BorderWidth'.

		(b) Draw menu title separator only if menu has borders
		or bevels.

		(c) Add icon name to f.identify while presented in
		InfoWindow.

		(d) Restored twm's original siconify_bits[] Bitmap logo
		in DrawXLogoImage() in util.c if logo size not greater
		than this original bitmap.  Otherwise XmuDrawLogo() is
		used (which is probably stale code as of now).

		(e) 'DefaultFont' keyword introduced

    March 9, 2004
        [events.c] [menus.c]
            Added checks for the number of rodent buttons and VTWM
            Windows entries. Fixed a bug causing sporadic restarts
            when realizing unmanaged windows.

            From Jennifer Elaan <jen@elaan.com>, Seth Robertson
            <seth@baka.org>, and Callum Gibson <callum.gibson@db.com>:
                Patches for the above.

    November 2 - 11, 2003
        [applets.c] [desktop.c] [events.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c]
        [twm.c] [screen.h]
            Fixed a vertical placement error in applet regions. The
            f.movescreen function supports sound and honors cancels now
            (moved functionality from event handlers to the function
            itself). Fixed "raise window regardless of MoveDelta" bugs
            introduced on May 23 - 27. Optionally preserve the previous
            move and resize raise behaviour. Some shaping optimizations.
            Depreciated the motion event handler. Reduced server grabs.

            Added the following variable:
                RaiseOnStart

    September 21 & 22, 2003
        Tweaked stuff all over the place for a cleaner compile.

        [add_window.c] [events.c] [menus.c]
            Fixed an UsePPosition bug, a restart bug, a sound bug, and
            an instance of unfreed memory.

    September 18, 2003
        [*akefile*] [parse.c]
            Let lexers track line numbers by default.

    September 14 - 17, 2003
        Moved the nexpm/ directory into contrib/. Moved the sample
        resource files and directories in the contrib/ directory into
        contrib/vtwmrc/.

        [*akefile*] [add_window.c] [doors.c] [events.c] [gc.c] [icons.c]
        [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [twm.h] [util.h]
            Added internationalization (I18N) support. Woo-woo!
            Better handling of missing or empty string resources.

    September 10, 2003
        [add_window.c] [gram.y] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [add_window.h]
        [screen.h] [twm.h]
            Added code to ignore "shift states" for bindings.

            Added the following variable:
                IgnoreModifiers k

    June 3, 2003
        [menus.c]
            Better sound handling in the (de)iconify and warp functions.

    May 27, 2003
        [iconmgr.c] [events.c] [menus.c] [resize.c]
            Fixed a bug when removing icon manager entries. Almost fixed
            stacking order bugs when resizing windows (the raise still
            occurs before the movement when opaque resizes are done on
            windows with squeezed titlebars). Cancelled resizes now work
            correctly, except for the above case.

    May 23 & 24, 2003
        [menus.c]
            Fixed stacking order bugs when moving windows (the raise
            now occurs after the movement). Cancelled moves now work
            correctly.

    November 15, 2002
        [menus.c] [parse.c] [sound.c] [parse.h] [sound.h]
            Allow sounds to be played "ad hoc".

            Added the following function:
                f.playsound s

    November 8 & 11, 2002
        [add_window.c] [events.c] [ parse.c] [twm.h]
            Support for MWM hints (currently, honor "noborder" and
            "notitle" hints). Fixed some off-by-clientborderwidth
            window placement bugs, an off-by-one malloc(), a null
            pointer reference, and a ConfigureNotify propogation bug.

            From Jonathan Paisley <jp@dcs.gla.ac.uk>:
                Patches for the above.

    November 6 & 7, 2002
        [*akefile*] [twm.c] [vtwm.man]
            Reduced the size of the compiled-in system.vtwmrc array.
            The command line can specify that no startup file be used.
            Updated the man page to reflect the compiled-in defaults.

    October 30 & 31, 2002
        [system.vtwmrc*] [add_window.c] [events.c] [icons.c] [gram.y]
        [iconmgr.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [iconmgr.h]
        [menus.h] [screen.h] [twm.h]
            Opened up icon managers and menus to user-specified images.
            The interfaces to all the built-in pixmap drawing functions
            have been made uniform.

            Added the following keywords:
                IconManagerPixmap s
                MenuIconPixmap s
            Changed the following variable:
                ShallowReliefWindowButton

    October 27, 2002
        [add_window.c] [gram.y] [events.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c]
        [menus.h] [screen.h]
            The f.warpto function accepts VTWM-style wildcards now.
            The f.warpring function has been fixed. Again.
            Prohibit windows from being added to the WindowRing list.

            From Jonathan Paisley <jp@dcs.gla.ac.uk>:
                Patches for NoWindowRing.

            Added the following variable:
                NoWindowRing l

    October 25 & 26, 2002
        [add_window.c] [events.c] [parse.c] [resize.c] [twm.c] [util.c]
        [screen.h] [twm.h]
            Obsoleted the SunkFocusHighlightWindow variable with new
            built-in highlight pixmaps, :xpm:raisedbox, :xpm:sunkenbox,
            :xpm:raisedlines, and :xpm:sunkenlines. Fixed some titlebar
            highlight exposure bugs.

            Changed the following keyword:
                TitleHighlight s
            Removed the following variable:
                SunkFocusHighlightWindow

    October 20, 2002
        [parse.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [screen.h]
            Chmod 0600 $(HOME)/vtwm.pid.
            Allow the 3D borders of titled windows to be unadorned.
            Fixed the 3D borders of titled windows when BeNiceToColormap
            is set.

            Added the following variable:
                NoBorderDecorations

    October 17 & 18, 2002
        [system.vtwmrc*] [add_window.c] [gram.y] [menus.c] [twm.c]
        [util.c]
            Refinements to the titlebar: The title bevel can now frame
            the entire titlebar when built-in 3D buttons are not full
            height. Buttons can now "extend into" the title bevel and
            frame padding. The highlight area (or absence of) is handled
            correctly now. The built-in 3D highlight is now available
            with or without a title bevel. Enabled signed-integer data
            handling in the resource file parser.

            Changed the following variables:
                ButtonIndent n
                FramePadding n
                TitleBevelWidth n
                TitlePadding n

    October 16, 2002
        [gram.y] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h]
            Allow warp functions to position the pointer at the center
            of windows.

            Added the following variable:
                WarpCentered s

    September 30, October 2 - 6, 2002
        [desktop.c] [events.c] [menus.c] [resize.c] [events.h] [menus.h]
        [resize.h]
            Refinements to the f.resize and f.move functions: Both are
            now single rodent button operations from any context, and both
            warp the pointer back to the virtual desktop when started from
            there. The wireframe is drawn immediately, ignoring MoveDelta.
            MoveDelta is otherwise used consistantly now. Fixed some icon
            move and resize bugs. Large chunks of relevant code changed,
            moving operations from event handlers to the function itself
            and merging/removing redundant code.

            Changed the following functions:
                f.move
                f.resize

    September 26, 2002
        [menus.c]
            Removed the limitations of the f.startwm argument.

            Changed the following function:
                f.startwm s

    September 24, 2002
        [add_window.c] [gram.y] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h]
            The UsePPosition variable accepts a list now.

            Changed the following variable:
                UsePPosition s l

    September 17, 2002
        [menus.c]
            Fixed a race condition when f.squeeze* functions are invoked
            from a window menu while Opaque* variables are set.
            Prevent f.squeeze* functions when DontSqueezeTitle is set.

    September 13, 2002
        [resize.c]
            Adjust the pointer back to the window at the end of window
            resizes as required.
            Constrain virtual desktop resizes to multiples of PanDistance
            when SnapRealScreen is set.

    September 9, 2002
        [menus.c] [parse.c] [parse.h]
            Fixed warp bugs when windows are borderless or shaped.

            From Seth Robertson <seth@baka.org>:
                Patches for passing raw key and rodent button events
                to windows.

            Added the following functions:
                f.bindbuttons
                f.bindkeys
                f.unbindbuttons
                f.unbindkeys

    September 1, 2002
        VTWM 5.4.6a released for public consumption.
        vtwm-5.4.6-to-5.4.6a.udiff patch file released.

    August 25, 2002
        [add_window.c]
            Better random placement of large windows.

            From Seth Robertson <seth@baka.org>:
                Patch for the above.

    August 23, 2002
        [add_window.c] [applets.c] [gram.y] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h]
            Support for borderless windows.

            From Tim Wiess <tim@zetaflops.net>:
                Patches for the above.

            Added the following variable:
                NoBorder l

    April 28, 2002
        Improved the list parser in contrib/support/sysrc_add_apps.sh.

    April 9, 2002
        [events.c]
            Fixed a focus problem with transient windows.

    December 2, 2001
        [menus.c] [twm.c]
            Added "-p" command line switch for a runtime PID file,
            $HOME/vtwm.pid.

    November 20, 2001
        [add_window.c]
            MakeTitle now overrides NoTitle like it's supposed to.

    November 15, 2001
        [add_window.c] [doors.c] [menus.c]
            Doors are drawn during opaque interactive creation now.

    November 8, 2001
        [events.c] [menus.c] [version.c]
            Fixed bugs I introduced regarding icon managers and warp
            rings. This should end f.warpring problems.

    November 3, 2001
        VTWM 5.4.6 released for public consumption.

    October 20 & 21, 2001
        [*akefile*] [applets.c] [gram.y] [icons.c] [lex.l] [list.c]

            Fixed window resizing via icon managers and the virtual
            desktop and window moves (f.move) via the virtual desktop.
            Improved virtual desktop updates after window resizes and
            moves. Zooms are aware of icon managers now. Random zooms
            during deiconification are controlled by a variable now.

            Added the following variable:
                ZoomZoom

    October 2 & 3, 2001
        [events.c] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [parse.h]
        [screen.h]
            A new feature to make icon managers function strictly as
            icon managers, listing only iconified windows.

            Added the following variable:
                StrictIconManager
            Added the following function:
                f.stricticonmgr

    September 24 - 28, 2001
        A new script in the contrib/support directory can add installed
        applications to the system default resource file.

        [*akefile*] [system.vtwmrc*] [add_window.c] [desktop.c]
        [iconmgr.c]
            Ensure the compiled-in resources and build info are current.
            Made the system default resource files a bit more useful
            and appealing. Fixed transposed default desktop foreground
            and background colors.

            From Michael Dales <michael@dcs.gla.ac.uk>:
                Work on the bug where windows may be mapped in desktop
                (0,0) regardless of the desktop's virtual location.

            From Rolf Neugebauer <neugebar@dcs.gla.ac.uk>:
                Fixed positioning errors for the icon manager and
                virtual desktop windows.

    August 16, 2001
        [gram.y] [parse.c] [sound.c]
            Added micro-manageable volume control.

            Changed the following variable:
                Sounds l

    August 3, 2001
        Added another build hint to the INSTALL file.

    June 22 & 23, 2001
        Updated the doc and contrib directories.

        [*akefile*] [events.c] [gram.y] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c] [parse.c]
        [sound.c] [twm.c] [menus.h] [parse.h] [screen.h] [sound.h] [twm.h]
            Sound effects are now supported, by way of the rplay library
            and daemon.

            Added the following variables:
                PauseOnExit n
                PauseOnQuit n
                SoundHost s
                Sounds l
                SoundVolume n
            Added the following function:
                f.sounds

    October 24 & 31, 2000
        [doors.c] [menus.c]
            Sanity checks on door renames. Fixed two menu repaint bugs.

    August 23, 2000
        [menus.c]
            Fixed a menu scroll bug.

    June 14 & 21, 2000
        [menus.c]
            Plugged holes where executing f.warptoiconmgr when thene
            is no icon manager to warp to, and f.warpclass* when there
            is no class, window, or focus, blew VTWM out of the water.

    June 4, 2000
        [twm.c] [util.c] [screen.h] [twm.h]
            Added four new built-in window button images: ":darrow",
            ":rarrow", ":xpm:darrow", and ":xpm:rarrow".

    May 28 - 31, 2000
        Added two more build hints to the INSTALL file.

        [iconmgr.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [menus.h] [parse.h]
        [screen.h]
            When the pointer would end up in an AutoPan border on warps,
            it is adjusted out, preventing unwanted screen pans. All the
            f.*iconmgr warp functions honor the WarpSnug and WarpWindows
            variables now (or absence of). The WarpSnug state can now be
            toggled.

            From Ugen Antsilevitch <ugen@xonix.com>:
                Support for warping only to visible windows.

            Added the following variable:
                WarpVisible
            Added the following functions:
                f.warpsnug
                f.warpvisible

    May 22 - 24, 2000
        [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [menus.h] [screen.h]
            Added "scrollability" to menus that would be taller than the
            display (inspired by the neXtaw SimpleMenu widget).

            Added the following variables:
                MenuScrollBorderWidth n
                MenuScrollJump n

    April 1, 2000
        Added another build hint to the INSTALL file.

        [menus.c]
            Made the pointer warp to the titlebar on a squeeze operation
            if WarpCursor is set on, a la zoom operations.

    September 28, 1999
        [desktop.c] [icons.c] [util.c]
            When moving an application window in the virtual desktop, the
            border of the corresponding real screen window now highlights
            as required. Streamlined the handling of transparent pixmaps
            for window buttons, improving exposure response to pointer-
            driven focus changes.

    September 21, 1999
        [add_window.c] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c]
            Icon managers now honor the IconifyByUnmapping resource.
            Fixed a bug where removing the last entry in an iconified
            icon manager didn't unmap that icon, and it contained an
            empty entry when deiconified. Fixed the f.hideiconmgr and
            f.showiconmgr functions so that they now work against icon
            managers that are defined with the IconManagers resource.
            More work on the "Don't iconify if can't deiconify" logic.

    September 14 & 15, 1999
        [*akefile*] [events.c] [menus.c]
            Fixed the notorious "Can't resize or move from icon managers
            and menus not of the root or window in question" bug. Woo-woo!

            From Mehul N. Sanghvi <mehul@kirsun.ne.mediaone.net>:
                Additional tweaks to the *akefile*s for more flexible
                installations.

    September 10 & 11, 1999
        Moved the man page into the doc directory. On request, renamed
        the lnf directory to contrib. 

        [*akefile*] [events.c] [menus.c] [resize.c]
            Changed the *akefile*s to accomodate the above, as the man
            page is now included in 'make install'. Reverted the setting
            of the context of a door's frame to that prior to the change
            on May 13 (it wasn't needed after all). Added code to prevent
            iconifying windows that don't have provision to deiconify or
            otherwise restore them. Fixed f.destroy and f.delete so that
            they can be safely used on doors, icon managers, and the
            virtual desktop. Fixed the zooming of doors, icon managers
            and the virtual desktop so that their contents adjust to the
            new size.

    June 18 & 22, 1999
        [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [screen.h]
            Fixed a bug, noted by "digs", where the truncation of long
            titles messed up in titlebars that don't have any left-side
            buttons. Added a new variable to see that iconified transient
            windows of an iconified parent window aren't deiconified when
            that parent is.

            Added the following variable:
                DontDeiconifyTransients

    May 22, 1999
        [applets.c] [icons.c]
            The same small tweak in both to have the region layout
            logic disregard grid spacing in determining whether a
            window will fit (clarified the man page accordingly).

    May 10 & 13, 1999
        [doors.c] [events.c] [menus.c] [util.c]
            Relaxed the door geometry parser, allowing omission of
            the position. Fixed a bug where rodent button events on a
            door's frame didn't correctly set the context, and added
            a kludge to "fix" not getting the rodent button up event.
            Applied the XPM library's color closeness attribute to
            external pixmap images. Updated the resource files in lnf
            to demonstrate some of m4's capabilities.

    April 26 & 27, 1999
        [*akefile*] [add_window.c] [applets.c] [doors.c] [events.c]
        [gram.y] [icons.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [regions.c] [twm.c]
        [regions.h] [screen.h]
            By cleverly re-using the code for icon regions, a new window
            management scheme, applet regions, is born! Moved the generic
            functions of icons.c into a new regions.c, renamed icons.h
            to regions.h, copied and modified the remaining icons.c to
            create applets.c, and made all this known to the rest of the
            modules above. Setting up all those little tool applications
            is now just a matter of dropping them into a list resource!

            Added the following variable:
                AppletRegion g s s n n l

    February 28 & March 1, 1999
        [doors.c] [events.c] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c] [resize.c] [events.h]
            Doors, icon managers, and the virtual desktop now get redrawn
            during opaque resizes (I have yet to figure out how to redraw
            doors during interactive creation). The first two also have
            minimum sizes imposed on them now. Fixed the icon manager's
            class assignment; it's visible to resource list entries now.
            Skip re-mapping of the virtual desktop to clean up outline
            droppings if the window moved or resized is itself.

    February 22 & 23, 1999
        [desktop.c] [menus.c] [resize.c]
            Added a trap to prevent resizing windows via the virtual
            desktop (it's horribly broken). Imposed a minimum size on
            the virtual desktop, that of the scaled real screen.

    February 20, 1999
        [add_window.c] [events.c] [parse.c] [twm.c]
            The window's icon name now has it's own memory space; this
            to keep some apps from blowing VTWM out of the water when
            they change it. Added support for user-defined m4 parameters
            passed from the command line.

    February 15 & 16, 1999
        [desktop.c] [icons.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h]
            If the RealScreenBorderWidth resource is defined, is there any
            reason why the UseRealScreenBorder resource wouldn't be? More
            fixes for the virtual desktop; these to properly accomodate the
            real screen's border.

            From Caveh Frank Jalali <caveh@eng.sun.com>:
                A last tweak for icon images on multiple screens.

            Removed the following variable:
                UseRealScreenBorder

    February 10 & 13, 1999
        [events.c] [resize.c] [util.c]
            Hacked in code to see that the virtual desktop's bevel gets
            redrawn after being resized. Ick.

            From Caveh Frank Jalali <caveh@eng.sun.com>:
                Tweaks to correct the painting of external images on
                multiple screens.

    February 5 - 9, 1999
        [system.vtwmrc*] [desktop.c] [doors.c] [events.c] [parse.c]
        [twm.c] [util.c] [screen.h] [twm.h]
            Doors and the virtual desktop can now be rendered in 3D.
            Doors now override real screen snapping on entry. Fixed a
            few bugs regarding the virtual desktop when it's resized;
            these may have been responsible for the problems noted in
            previous releases, because they don't happen anymore!
            Added a resource to override title truncation when in short
            titlebars and icon managers.

            Added the following variables:
                DoorBevelWidth n
                VirtualDesktopBevelWidth n
                NoPrettyTitles

    January 30, 1999
        [*akefile*] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [version.c]
            Added compiled-in options to the build info in the version
            window.

            From Jason Gloudon <jdg@world.std.com>:
                Added m4 pre-processing of resource files. Woo-woo!

    January 10 & 14, 1999
        [add_window.c] [doors.c] [menus.c] [parse.c]
            Added proper tests for success of XGetWindowProperty() calls
            to fix getting icon names, window states, and pixel atoms from
            the X server. Fixed a bug in the display of a renamed door.

    December 26 & 28, 1998
        [icons.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [screen.h]
            Fixed a bug where icon bitmaps were rendered with the wrong
            color. The X database resource "*bitmapFilePath" is now
            searched for pixmap image files, like that for bitmap image
            files.

    December 10 & 14, 1998
        [desktop.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [menus.h] [parse.h]
        [screen.h]
            Non-nailed icons can now stay put at their locations on the
            virtual desktop. The titlebar height now adjusts to external
            button images. Added a few button image files to lnf.

            Added the following variable:
                StaticIconPositions
            Added the following function:
                f.staticiconpositions

    November 15 - 16, 1998
        [Imakefile] [desktop.c] [events.c] [menus.c]
            Fixed the PanResistance resource's not recognizing when the
            pointer has left the autopan windows. Fixed the "orphaning"
            of intermediate parent menu(s) when skipping them for some
            superior parent menu.

            From Steve Ratcliffe <sterat@dial.pipex.com>:
                Moved $(NO_XPM_SUPPORT) into DEFINES for global
                visibility, and removed several SpecialObjectRule()s.

            From Michel Eyckmans <mce@ping.be>:
                Fixed deferred execution on keyboard events when the
                root window has focus.

    September 27, 1998
        [menus.c] [resize.c] [version.c]

            From Goran Larsson <hoh@lorelei.approve.se>:
                Fixed text display bug in the size and position windows.

        VTWM 5.4.5a released for public consumption.
        vtwm-5.4.5-to-5.4.5a.txt patch file released.

    September 14, 1998
        Established a directory, doc, for all the documentation
        that has accumulated through time. The HINTS file is now
        called INSTALL, and is more comprehensive.

        [util.c]
            The menu, resize and X logo built-in bitmaps now account
            for the ButtonBevelWidth variable.

        VTWM 5.4.5 released for public consumption.

    September 8 - 10, 1998
        [events.c] [iconmgr.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h]
            Fixed a bug with icon manager geometries that would blow
            VTWM out of the water. Added code to make it a little
            harder to accidentally pan to an adjacent virtual screen.

            Added the following variable:
                PanResistance n

    September 4 - 5, 1998
        [events.c] [menus.c] [resize.c] [resize.h]
            Fixed another pixmap oversight, this one for icons,
            noted by C. F. Jalali. Applied the MoveDelta variable
            to window resizing and initial menu highlighting.

            From Steve Ratcliffe <sterat@dial.pipex.com>:
                Fixed a bug for the AutoPan variable, when the pan
                windows are obscured by a newly-raised window.

    September 2, 1998
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [util.c] [util.h]
            Plugged a memory leak, as noted by Jason Gloudon, where
            transparent pixmap resources weren't freed before re-use.

    August 23 - 27, 1998
        [add_window] [events.c] [icons.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c]
        [util.c]
            Fixed a bug where the titlebar highlight wasn't
            erased when focus was unset and the BeNiceToColormap
            and SunkFocusWindowTitle variables were used.

            From Steve Ratcliffe <sterat@dial.pipex.com>:
                Tweaks to suppress menu highlighting on mapping,
                relieve CPU consumption on menus bound to rodent
                buttons, and allow a second rodent button press to
                cancel menus. A safer approach to the RaiseDelay
                variable's timeout.

            From Jason Gloudon <jgloudon@bbn.com>:
                Tweaks to streamline icon bitmap handling, and
                fixed the painting of non-transparent titlebar
                highlight pixmaps.

            From Caveh Frank Jalali <caveh@eng.sun.com>:
                Fixed a bug I introduced where non-3D borders were
                always rendered as highlighted! Tweaks to correct
                the painting of built-in images on multiple screens.
                Fixed some bugs in colormap management. Tweaks for
                application-defined icon border widths.

    August 10 - 14, 1998
        All references to and mention of the shadow contrast and
        shadow width variables have been changed to *BevelContrast
        and *BevelWidth.

        [add_window.c] [doors.c] [events.c] [iconmgr.c] [icons.c]
        [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [version.c]
        [screen.h]
            Fixed an oversight, color (XPM) image support for the
            UnknownIcon variable and application-specified icons.
            Window buttons are now beveled when external images are
            used. The *BevelWidth variables render the UseThreeD*
            variables obsolete. The ThreeDBorderWidth variable is
            superfluous, too, no?

            Removed the following variables:
                UseThreeDBorders
                UseThreeDIcons
                UseThreeDIconManagers
                UseThreeDMenus
                UseThreeDTitles
                ThreeDBorderWidth n
            Added the following variables:
                ButtonBevelWidth n
                IconBevelWidth n
            Changed the following variable:
                UnknownIcon s

    July 31 & August 3, 1998
        Discovered that VTWM supports a subset of regex wildcards for
        list variables! It's in the man page now.

        [events.c] [menus.c] [twm.c] [twm.h]
            Another tweak to the f.warpclass* functions, to properly
            handle multiple icon managers. Added a signal handler for
            external restarts (adapted from TVTWM pl11).

    July 15 - 17, 1998
        [desktop.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c] [parse.h]
            Added code to restart using a specified window manager.
            A few changes to grab the server during non-opaque moves
            and resizes, regardless of the NoGrabServer variable.

            Added the following function:
                f.startwm s

    July 2 & 14, 1998
        [events.c]
            Made the borders of windows without titlebars forward key
            events to the application, like titlebars do. I think the
            various warps from icon managers are sorted out now.

    June 25, 1998
        [gram.y] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h]
            Aliased a new variable, OldFashionedVtwmWindowsMenu, to the
            OldFashionedTwmWindowsMenu variable, just for consistancy.

            From Erik Agsjo <erik.agsjo@aktiedirekt.com>:
                Added code to support two new variable(s).

            Added the following variables:
                DontShowInTwmWindows l
                DontShowInVtwmWindows l
                OldFashionedVtwmWindowsMenu

    June 10 - 15, 1998
        [events.c] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c]
            Had to make an exception for icon managers regarding warps,
            that their window border isn't the destination, because I
            can't figure out how to make the appropriate entry active
            when one isn't without screwing up something else. BAH! Added
            a few "prevents" when there isn't an icon manager mapped. The
            f.warpclass* functions now behave correctly when an empty
            string is used on windows without titlebars or on VTWM-specific
            windows.

    June 3 - 6, 1998
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [events.c] [menus.c] [resize.c]
            Made initial window placement adjust to client borderwidths,
            depending on related variables. The virtual desktop is now
            re-mapped after non-opaque moves and resizes to clean up any
            outline droppings left on it when the Virtual*MotionEvents
            variables are set. The window border of the virtual desktop
            now honors key bindings to "virtual". Doors and their borders
            are now sensitive to key bindings, too.

    May 27, 1998
        [events.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h]
            Added code to not set focus from icon manager entries to
            the corresponding application windows, for binding keys that
            otherwise would get forwarded.

            Added the following variable:
                NoIconManagerFocus

    May 24, 1998
        Established a directory, lnf (look n' feel), for the previously
        included sample resource and image files, and added a couple
        more to it. Renamed some files: marcel.vtwm to .vtwmrc-marcel,
        djhjr.vtwmrc to .vtwmrc-95ish, djhjr.vtwmpm to djhjr.xpm,
        realscr.bm to nestedsqu.xbm, and siconify.bm to siconify.xbm.

        [iconmgr.c] [util.c]
            Changed to handle the above.

    May 17 - 23, 1998
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c] [twm.c] [util.c]
        [screen.h] [util.h]
            Found and plugged the hole in the original menu handler that
            would blow VTWM out of the water when the pointer scrolled
            down past the last entry. Gave the icon manager and virtual
            desktop resource classes. The f.warpclass* functions will now
            exhibit reasonable behavior when an empty string is used on
            windows without titlebars or on VTWM-specific windows. The
            three entries of the Pixmaps variable now fully support color
            (XPM) images - this does render the nexpm utility obsolete in
            regard to VTWM, but it's still included in the distribution.
            The external image support for window buttons is better, but
            still not perfect (see BUGS).

            Changed the following variable:
                Pixmaps l

    May 11 - 13, 1998
        [add_window.c] [events.c] [menus.c] [twm.h]
            The f.warpclassprev and f.warpclassnext functions now accept
            an empty string, meaning the class of the window with focus,
            and the first actually goes backwards now! Tweaks made to those
            and the f.warpring function so its destination is a titlebar or
            border like the other warp functions, and it now remembers the
            window to warp to when invoked from the root window, unless the
            target window was unmapped (leaving the pointer on the root
            window), in which case it will no longer skip the first window
            in the ring. All warping functions now honor the WarpUnmapped
            variable a la the f.warpto function.

            Changed the following functions:
                f.warpclassprev s
                f.warpclassnext s
                f.warpnewest
                f.warpring s
                f.warptoiconmgr s

        [menus.h] [screen.h] [twm.h]
            The 3D rendition of icons is now governed by its own variable.
            The 3D bevel widths are configurable now, and related elements
            are sized and positioned accordingly. Virtual window geometries
            now account for 3D borders. Virtual-to-real window scaling and
            positioning errors have been reduced. The position window now
            reports during moves in the virtual desktop. Re-instated the
            effects of the RightHandSidePulldownMenus variable! Changed the
            foreground color for the built-in "TwmWindows" menu to that of
            the global variable, and aliased it's name to "VTWM Windows",
            just for consistancy's sake.

            Added the following variables:
                UseThreeDIcons
                BorderBevelWidth n
                IconManagerBevelWidth n

                MenuBevelWidth n
                TitleBevelWidth n

            From Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>:
                Even more tweaks for portability, most notably, restoring
                X11R4 compatability by not including the X11R5,6 headers
                Xosdefs.h and Xfuncs.h! X11R5,6 don't seem to mind.

    April 20 - 23, 1998
        [nexpm/nexpm.c]

            From Steve Ratcliffe <sterat@dial.pipex.com>:
                Added a test for the child window of the selected window.

        [*akefile*] [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [doors.c] [events.c]
        [lex.l] [menus.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [doors.h] [parse.h]
            Purged GNU-specific syntax from this new Imakefile, and changed
            the NO_PUTENV definition to NEED_PUTENV_F, for consistancy.
            Added code to support pasting a name into a door (adapted from
            VTWM 5.2b).

            Added the following function:
                f.namedoor

            From Steve Ratcliffe <sterat@dial.pipex.com>:
                Many tweaks made in the name of Portability. The snug
                variables now take border width into account.

            From Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>:
                Many more tweaks for portability's sake.

    April 14 - 17, 1998
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c]
        [twm.c] [resize.h] [screen.h]
            When windows are created, they now honor the opaque variables
            when the RandomPlacement variable is not set. While moving and
            resizing windows on the real screen, the virtual desktop now
            responds in kind, and visa-versa. The NoGrabServer variable now
            sees to it the server is actually not grabbed! The position
            window now reports during constrained moves.

            Added the following variables:
                VirtualReceivesMotionEvents
                VirtualSendsMotionEvents

    April 1 - 8, 1998
        [*akefile*] [system.vtwmrc*] [add_window.c] [gram.y] [menus.c]
        [parse.c] [resize.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [screen.h] [twm.h] [util.h]
            Added a define supporting a 2D or 3D system default resource
            file, and made that file a bit more useful. Added code for
            opaque resizing, and all opaque variables now support lists.
            Many tweaks to make titlebar-related variables consistant with
            respect to each other and 3D rendition of the various elements.

            Added the following variables:
                OpaqueResize [l]
                NoOpaqueResize [l]
                NoOpaqueMove [l]
            Changed the following variable:
                OpaqueMove [l]

   March 29 - 30, 1998
        [Imakefile] [events.c] [util.c]
            Added the system Imake.tmpl macro for flex's library (should
            be absent or an empty string on systems with lex). Added code
            to properly truncate, then add ellipses to, titles that are
            longer than the space they're drawn on.

    March 23 - 24, 1998
        [gram.y] [util.c]
            Fixed the rendition of a squeezed titlebar's right-side 3D
            border (a silly gunkulation error).

            From Jason Gloudon <jgloudon@bbn.com>:
                Support for bison.

    March 20 - 22, 1998
        [add_window.c] [util.c] [version.c]
            Added color image (XPM) support for window buttons. Jason's
            code for color icon images made it a breeze, but it's not
            perfect (see BUGS).

        VTWM 5.4.4c released for public consumption.
        vtwm-5.4.4b-to-5.4.4c.txt patch file released.

    March 14 - 15, 1998
        [events.c] [menus.c] [version.c]
            Fixed a bug where the window buttons would get painted with
            the border color when the background color should have been
            used.

            From Steve Ratcliffe <sterat@dial.pipex.com>:
                Fixed warping to titlebars not flush left.

        VTWM 5.4.4b released for public consumption.
        vtwm-5.4.4a-to-5.4.4b.txt patch file released.

    February 5, 1998
        [*akefile*] [events.c] [menus.c] [util.c] [version.c]
            Tweaks to accomodate the following made to the *akefile*s.

            From Takeharu Kato <magician@maekawa.is.uec.ac.jp>:
                Fixed a fault causing a SIGSEGV in the info window,
                and the use of a depreciated constant in the XPM library.

        VTWM 5.4.4a released for public consumption.
        vtwm-5.4.4-to-5.4.4a.txt patch file released.

    February 2, 1998
        VTWM 5.4.4 released for public consumption.

    January 27, 1998
        [add_window.c] [iconmgr.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h] [gram.y]
            Added a variable to tell the icon manager whether or not to
            highlight its entries as an indication of pointer location,
            regardless of the NoHighlight variable.

            Added the following variable:
                NoIconManagerHighlight

            From Nicholas Jacobs <nicholas_jacobs@hotmail.com>:
                A better effort at getting a name for the window.

    January 24, 1998
        [desktop.c] [menus.c]
            Allow screen warps to honor the SnapRealScreen variable.
            Added a kludge to "fix" screen warps to deiconifying windows
            not on the real screen (high degree of confidence it's not
            the source of the problem).

    January 21, 1998
        Added the HINTS file to the distribution. Moved and added many
        function declarations into header files (quieter builds!). Other
        miscellaneous tweaks.

    December 28, 1997, January 1 - 19, 1998
        [nexpm/nexpm.c]
            Changed the window name sought by `nexpm -vtwm ...` to match
            the virtual desktop's name. It's a wonder nobody's noticed!

        [*akefile*] [add_window.c] [cursor.c] [desktop.c] [doors.c]
        [events.c] [gc.c] [icons.c] [list.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c]
        [twm.c] [util.c] [util.h] [version.c] [screen.h] [gram.y]
            Rewrote most of the 3D border code, adding, among other things,
            drawing the top border segment when 3D borders are used with
            squeezed titlebars! Simplified the meaning of the SqueezeTitle
            variable list parameters. Fixed a bug causing SIGFPEs when pan
            distances are set to zero. Added a bug workaround to try to
            make managed windows used as transients behave, a la the
            FixTransientVirtualGeometries variable (seldom needed, just as
            bad, but mostly works). Fixed an oversight of mine, not
            initializing monochrome GCs! Enabled a variable to go easy on
            the colormap (doesn't render perfectly yet). Use the system
            Imake.tmpl macro for yacc and removed all escaped characters
            from the lastmake.c rule in the *akefile*s. Clarified the pan
            distance variable descriptions in the man page.

            Added the following variables:
                BeNiceToColormap
                FixManagedVirtualGeometries

            From Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>:
                On startup, VTWM now searches for user and system .vtwmrc
                files, then user and system .twmrc files, in this order.
                Fixed and added many declarations and definitions. Updated
                the man page. Support for HTML and Postscript versions of
                the man page added to the *akefile*s. 

            From Jason Gloudon <jgloudon@bbn.com>:
                Color image (XPM) support for icons.

        Added a pixmap (djhjr.vtwmpm) referenced in my resource file
        (djhjr.vtwmrc) for an example of the nexpm utility.

        Pruned the R4 Imakefile from the tree.

        Pruned the vtwmrc/ directory from the distribution tree. No offense
        to Mr. Betza, but it made little sense (to me), was five years old,
        was very esoteric, and anyone who wants it probably already has it.

    November 17, 1997
        VTWM 5.4.3 released for public consumption.

    November 17 - 19, 1997
        [events.c] [menus.c] [util.c] [util.h] [version.c]
            Fixed a bug where the wrong variable was being used to
            highlight the window border that has focus. Fixed an omission
            where the window buttons would not follow the border color
            when highlighted and the ButtonColorIsFrame variable is true.
            Added a hack to trap corrupted/invalid window button names.

    October 27, 1997
        VTWM 5.4.2 released for public consumption.

    March 12 - 14, 1997
        [add_window.c] [menus.c] [twm.c] [util.c]
            Added code to properly paint the window buttons in the same
            color as their titlebar on a restart operation. Woo-woo!
            Numerous changes to accomodate added buttons and squeezed
            titlebars - I had previously overlooked these. Made a few
            variables un-alterable when 3D appearances are used. Now
            closes the display before spawning the new WM on a restart
            operation - free alloc'd memory in the X server?

    September 25 - 26, 1996
        [menus.c]
            Changed code to properly scale menus to the fonts used.

    September 14 - 21, 1996
        [*akefile*] [add_window.c] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c] [resize.c]
        [twm.h] [util.c] [version.h] [*akefil*] [vtwm.man]
            Fixed a bug in zooms that I introduced! Applied the backing
            store and NoBackingStore variables to the Icon Manager and
            titlebars (defeats effects of RaiseDelay). Made the pointer
            warp to the titlebar on a zoom operation if WarpCursor is
            set on. The function f.showdesktopdisplay now deiconifies as
            required. Working on code to make the window buttons stay the
            same color as their titlebar on a restart operation (obviously
            wasn't thought about much before). Added build info to the
            version window by having the *akefile*s create a temporary C
            module.

            Added the following variable:
                ButtonColorIsFrame

    September 10 - 12, 1996
        [events.c] [menus.c]
            Added code preventing the virtual desktop window and Door
            windows from doing harm. Fixed a bug when trying to move the
            virtual desktop window with the pointer; see the notes in
            djhjr.vtwmrc pertaining to the virtual desktop, it's related,
            and the BUGS file.

    June 26, 1996
        [screen.h] [parse.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [vtwm.man]
            Tweaked the 3D menu icons to look a little more like menus.
            Made the 3D Icon Manager iconified indicators "shallow" to
            match the 3D menu icons. Added code for Motif-ish "shallow"
            relief in 3D titlebars and buttons to matches the others.

            Added the following variable:
                ShallowReliefWindowButton

    June 11, 1996
        [icons.c] [events.c]
            Tweaked the hard-coded geometries for a better 3D appearance
            on icons (looks best with IconBorderWidth set to 0).

    April 18 - May 19, 1996
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [doors.c] [doors.h] [events.c]
        [gram.y] [iconmgr.c] [iconmgr.h] [icons.c] [menus.c] [menus.h]
        [parse.c] [resize.c] [screen.h] [twm.c] [twm.h] [util.c] [util.h]
        [version.c]
            Modifications and/or additions to the above modules for
            a 3D appearance, menu separators, a position window, info
            window fonts, resize/position window locations, and other
            minor tweaks (listed below). All should be initialled and
            dated. Changed as many as convenient boolean shorts to bits in
            a Slim-Fast effort (the only executable code changed was due
            to renaming the variable SnapRealScreen to snapRealScreen; the
            shorts maybe reinstated with '#define ORIGINAL_SHORTS').
            Changed "Twm Door" to "VTWM Door", in the name of Consistancy.
            Changed "Virtual Desktop" to "VTWM Desktop". Ditto. Changed the
            code to center Door names in their windows. It *is* correct,
            but only looks more correct. Took liberties with the
            SunkFocusWindowTitle function. I think it more pleasing. Took
            liberties with other code too, look for '#ifdef ORIGINAL_'.
            A couple of changes for a cleaner compile (what were 'int'
            functions are now 'void', etc.). Rem'd out code no longer
            valid due to these changes.

            Added the following variables:
                SunkFocusWindowTitle
                UseThreeDIconManagers
                UseThreeDMenus
                UseThreeDTitles
                UseThreeDBorders
                ThreeDBorderWidth n
                ClearBevelContrast n
                DarkBevelContrast n
                InfoFont s
                ResizeRegion s
            Added the following function:
                f.separator

        Updated the man page.
        Included my .vtwmrc (djhjr.vtwmrc) in this distribution.

                StickyAbove (I didn't take any of the code for this from
                tvtwm; just the idea.)

        Mon Oct 18 21:14:04 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Fixed autopanning bug that would *sometimes* not allow
                AutoPan to work if the focus was on a window, since 
                the autopan windows (on the edges of the real screen)
                weren't raised.

        Sat Oct 16 18:23:43 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Nailed windows now *always* go on the real screen, wherever
                the real screen is.

        Wed Oct 13 12:21:54 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Aliased "f.stick" to "f.nail", for greater compatibility
                (or less incompatibility) between .vtwmrc and .tvtwmrc,
                just for the hell of it.

        Mon Oct 11 21:06:09 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Fixed a bug that would make the window manager mess up if
                "AutoPan 100" and "AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen 100"
                (a.k.a. "NaturalAutoPanBehavior") were set.  I wanted to
                set my window manager to behave like fvwm (in the
                autopanning sense of the word) when I discovered this.

        Mon Oct 11 09:14:58 PDT 1993 leisner@eso.mc.xerox.com (Marty Leisner)
                Included small patches to Imakefile from Marty Leisner.

        Mon Oct 11 17:04:35 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                NoDefaultTitleButtons
                NoDefaultMouseAndKeyboardBindings
                so someone could use either the default title or 
                keyboard bindings, but not necessarily both.

                Used another bug workaround to support negative door
                geometries; the old one I did messed up with positive door
                geometries, especially "+0+0".
