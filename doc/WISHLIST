WISHES FOR THE FUTURE OF VTWM
=============================

  * From vtwm-5.1 spawned two independent versions, vtwm-5.2 and vtwm-5.2b. 
    The features added to 5.2b are different from the ones added to 5.2, and
    I based my version(s) on 5.2 rather than 5.2b since in 5.2 the features
    were, in my humble opinion, more useful, while in 5.2b the new stuff was
    mostly `chrome' (e.g., XPM support, etc.).  I was seriously considering
    adding the features from 5.2b into 5.3, but I didn't have enough time.

    I would like to see most of the features from 5.2b merged into the next
    version, especially the color XPM support and m4 pre-processing of the
    *twmrc file.  See below for more info. --- DSE

    Summary feature list for version 5.2:

      DONE - jg
    * Added :random color specification, which generates colors on the fly.
    * Color XPM support for icons. DONE - jg, djhjr
    * Color XPM support for buttons. DONE (the titlebar highlight, the
      virtual desktop and it's real screen window, too!) - djhjr
    * 3D appearance on menus, titles, icons. DONE (the window's borders, the
      virtual desktop, info windows, doors, and icon managers, too!) - djhjr
    * Moving in and out of desktop.
    * Opaque resizing available. DONE - djhjr
    * Both OpaqueResize and OpaqueMove may specify lists of windows as
      opposed to being "global". DONE - djhjr
    * Can direct focus through desktop at real windows. When enabled, the
      desktop windows also indicate the focus highlight by using the border.
    * regexps can be used for lists in the vtwmrc. DONE - djhjr
    * Size information is displayed during both move and resize. DONE - djhjr
    * Size information can be centered in the screen. DONE (any of the
      screen corners, too!) - djhjr
    * Desktop size may be specified in multiples of real screen.
      IT'S THERE (see doc/.vtwmrc-*ish) - djhjr
    * Can "paste" a new name into a door. DONE - djhjr
    * Places property on root window giving virtual coordinates, in case
      other programs want to use this info. (e.g. xpostit).
    * Now uses a blank/icon startup screen while initialising.
    * Many bugfixes, especially to do with desktop stacking order and
      iconification/deiconification of the desktop windows.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------ end file

  * A better way of implementing StickyAbove and "VTWM Profile".

  * Support for user-defined icons in menus and the icon manager.
  * More coherent/uniform handling of XPM images, particularly where
    transparency is concerned.
  * I18n support. This will break X11R4 compatability if not done right.
