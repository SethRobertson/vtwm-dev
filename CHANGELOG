============ vtwm-5.4.N.tar.gz =============
hawkeyd@visi.com (D. J. Hawkey Jr. aka djhjr)

    February 2, 1998
        VTWM 5.4.4 released for public consumption.

    January 27, 1998
        [add_window.c] [iconmgr.c] [parse.c] [twm.c] [screen.h] [gram.y]
            Added a resource to tell the icon manager whether or not to
            highlight its entries as an indication of pointer location,
            regardless of the NoHighlight resource.

            Added the following resource:
                NoIconManagerHighlight

            From Nicholas Jacobs (nicholas_jacobs@hotmail.com):
                A better effort at getting a name for the window.

    January 24, 1998
        [desktop.c] [menus.c]
            Allow screen warps to honor the SnapRealScreen resource.
            Added a kludge to "fix" screen warps to de-iconifying windows
            not on the real screen (high degree of confidence it's not the
            source of the problem).

    January 21, 1998
        Added the HINTS file to the distribution. Moved and added many
        function declarations into header files (quieter builds!). Other
        miscellaneous tweaks.

    December 28, 1997, January 1 - 19, 1998
        [nexpm/nexpm.c]
            Changed the window name sought by `nexpm -vtwm ...` to match
            the virtual desktop's name. It's a wonder nobody's noticed!

        [*akefile*] [add_window.c] [cursor.c] [desktop.c] [doors.c]
        [events.c] [gc.c] [icons.c] [list.c] [menus.c] [parse.c] [resize.c]
        [twm.c] [util.c] [util.h] [screen.h] [gram.y]
            Rewrote most of the 3D border code, adding, among other things,
            drawing the top border segment when 3D borders are used with
            squeezed titles! Simplified the meaning of the SqueezeTitle
            resource list parameters. Fixed a bug causing SIGFPEs when pan
            distances are set to zero. Added a bug workaround to try to
            make managed windows used as transients behave, a la the
            FixTransientVirtualGeometries resource (seldom needed, just as
            bad, but mostly works). Fixed an oversight of mine, not
            initializing monochrome GCs! Enabled a resource to go easy on
            the colormap (doesn't render perfectly yet). Use the system
            Imake.tmpl macro for yacc and removed all escaped characters
            from the lastmake.c rule in the *akefile*s. Clarified the pan
            distance resource descriptions in the man page.

            Added the following resources:
                BeNiceToColormap
                FixManagedVirtualGeometries

            From Nelson H. F. Beebe (beebe@math.utah.edu):
                On startup, VTWM now searches for user and system .vtwmrc
                files, then user and system .twmrc files, in this order.
                Fixed and added many declarations and definitions. Updated
                the man page. Support for HTML and Postscript versions of
                the man page added to the *akefile*s. 

            From Jason Gloudon (jgloudon@bbn.com):
                Color image (XPM) support for icons.

        Added a pixmap (djhjr.vtwmpm) referenced in my resource file
        (djhjr.vtwmrc) for an example of the nexpm utility.

        Pruned the R4 Imakefile from the tree.

        Pruned the vtwmrc/ directory from the distribution tree. No offense
        to Mr. Betza, but it made little sense (to me), was five years old,
        was very esoteric, and anyone who wants it probably already has it.

    November 17, 1997
        VTWM 5.4.3 released for public consumption.

    November 17 - 19, 1997
        [events.c] [menus.c] [util.c] [util.h]
            Fixed a bug where the wrong resource was being used to
            highlight the window border that has focus. Fixed an omission
            where the window buttons would not follow the border color
            when highlighted and the ButtonColorIsFrame resource is true.
            Added a hack to trap corrupted/invalid window button names.

    October 27, 1997
        VTWM 5.4.2 released for public consumption.

    March 12 - 14, 1997
        [add_window.c] [menus.c] [twm.c] [util.c]
            Added code to properly paint the window buttons in the same
            color as their titlebar on a restart operation. Woo-woo!
            Numerous changes to accomodate added buttons and squeezed
            titlebars - I had previously overlooked these. Made a few
            resources un-alterable when 3D appearances are used. Now
            closes the display before spawning the new WM on a restart
            operation - free alloc'd memory in the X server?

    September 25 - 26, 1996
        [menus.c]
            Changed code to properly scale menus to the fonts used.

    September 14 - 21, 1996
        [add_window.c] [iconmgr.c] [menus.c] [resize.c] [twm.h] [util.c]
        [version.h] [*akefil*] [vtwm.man]
            Fixed a bug in zooms that I introduced! Applied the backing
            store and NoBackingStore resources to the Icon Manager and
            titlebars (defeats effects of RaiseDelay). Made the cursor
            warp to the titlebar on a zoom operation if WarpCursor is
            set on. The function f.showdesktopdisplay now deiconifies as
            required. Working on code to make the window buttons stay the
            same color as their titlebar on a restart operation (obviously
            wasn't thought about much before). Added build info to the
            Version window by having the *makefil*s create a temporary C
            module.

            Added the following resource:
                ButtonColorIsFrame

    September 10 - 12, 1996
        [events.c] [menus.c]
            Added code preventing the virtual desktop window and Door
            windows from doing harm. Fixed a bug when trying to move the
            virtual desktop window with the pointer; see the notes in
            djhjr.vtwmrc pertaining to the virtual desktop, it's related,
            and the BUGS file.

    June 26, 1996
        [screen.h] [parse.c] [twm.c] [util.c] [vtwm.man]
            Tweaked the 3D menu icons to look a little more like menus.
            Made the 3D Icon Manager iconified indicators "shallow" to
            match the 3D menu icons. Added code for Motif-ish "shallow"
            relief in 3D titlebars and buttons to matches the others.

            Added the following resource:
                ShallowReliefWindowButton

    June 11, 1996
        [icons.c] [events.c]
            Tweaked the hard-coded geometries for a better 3D appearance
            on icons (looks best with IconBorderWidth set to 0).

    April 18 - May 19, 1996
        [add_window.c] [desktop.c] [doors.c] [doors.h] [events.c]
        [gram.y] [iconmgr.c] [iconmgr.h] [icons.c] [menus.c] [menus.h]
        [parse.c] [resize.c] [screen.h] [twm.c] [twm.h] [util.c] [util.h]
        [version.c]
            Modifications and/or additions to the above modules for
            a 3D appearance, menu separators, a position window, info
            window fonts, resize/position window locations, and other
            minor tweaks (listed below). All should be initialled and
            dated. Changed as many as convenient boolean shorts to bits in
            a Slim-Fast effort (the only executable code changed was due
            to renaming the variable SnapRealScreen to snapRealScreen; the
            shorts maybe reinstated with '#define ORIGINAL_SHORTS').
            Changed "Twm Door" to "VTWM Door", in the name of Consistancy.
            Changed "Virtual Desktop" to "VTWM Desktop". Ditto. Changed the
            code to center Door names in their windows. It *is* correct,
            but only looks more correct. Took liberties with the
            SunkFocusWindowTitle function. I think it more pleasing. Took
            liberties with other code too, look for '#ifdef ORIGINAL_'.
            A couple of changes for a cleaner compile (what were 'int'
            functions are now 'void', etc.). Rem'd out code no longer
            valid due to these changes.

            Added the following resources:
                SunkFocusWindowTitle
                UseThreeDIconManagers
                UseThreeDMenus
                UseThreeDTitles
                UseThreeDBorders
                ThreeDBorderWidth n
                ClearShadowContrast n
                DarkShadowContrast n
                InfoFont s
                ResizeRegion s

            Added the following function:
                f.separator

        Updated the man page.
        Included my .vtwmrc (djhjr.vtwmrc) in this distribution.

        See also the files 4.ANNOUNCE, 4.README, and BUGS.

============ vtwm-5.3.tar.gz =============
dsembr01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu (Darren S. Embry)

        Tuesday, 1994 January 4, 16:43:32 EST 
                [menus.c] Autopanned windows are now raised when Autopan is
                turned back on via f.autopan.

        Monday, 1994 January 3, 20:49:22 EST
                f.stickyabove (or f.nailedabove)

        Monday, 1994 January 3, 19:29:07 EST / dsembr01
                [twm.c] The "VTWM Profile" function is now executed after
                starting/restarting the window manager.

        Friday, 1993 November 26, 15:37:01 EST / dsembr01
                [vtwm.man] Some previously undocumented functions have now
                been documented.  Please use them at your own risk:

                f.cut
                f.cutfile
                f.file
                f.movescreen
                f.twmrc [same as f.restart anyway]
                f.version

        Saturday, 1993 November 6, 19:03:28 EST / dsembr01
                [desktop.c] Small bug fix regarding representations of
                nailed windows on the virtual desktop; it was obvious and
                obviously unintentional.

        Tue Nov  2 20:05:44 EST 1993 dsembr01
                WarpSnug

        Wed Oct 27 12:29:38 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                MenuTitleFont (this code also came from tvtwm)

        Tue Oct 26 19:41:04 EDT 1993 pf@z-code.z-code.com (Paul Falstad)
                NoIconifyIconManagers
                StayUpOptionalMenus
                WarpToTransients
                f.warp
                f.warpclassnext
                f.warpclassprev
                f.warptonewest

        Mon Oct 25 21:08:40 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                If StickyAbove is set, f.nail will raise all sticky windows
                to make sure nailed windows stay above.

        Mon Oct 25 19:48:33 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                FixTransientVirtualGeometries, a BUG WORKAROUND!!
                (Any better ideas, folks? -- DSE)

        Mon Oct 25 17:13:00 EDT 1993 dsembr01 
                DontInterpolateTitles, from tvtwm -- thanks to
                cross@eng.umd.edu (Chris P. Ross) for letting me use his
                code.

        Sun Oct 24 16:16:52 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                f.lower now won't lower the window if it is nailed down and
                StickyAbove is set.

        Tue Oct 19 18:03:35 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                StickyAbove (I didn't take any of the code for this from
                tvtwm; just the idea.)

        Mon Oct 18 21:14:04 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Fixed autopanning bug that would *sometimes* not allow
                AutoPan to work if the focus was on a window, since 
                the autopan windows (on the edges of the real screen)
                weren't raised.

        Sat Oct 16 18:23:43 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Nailed windows now *always* go on the real screen, wherever
                the real screen is.

        Wed Oct 13 12:21:54 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Aliased "f.stick" to "f.nail", for greater compatibility
                (or less incompatibility) between .vtwmrc and .tvtwmrc,
                just for the hell of it.

        Mon Oct 11 21:06:09 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                Fixed a bug that would make the window manager mess up if
                "AutoPan 100" and "AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen 100"
                (a.k.a. "NaturalAutoPanBehavior") were set.  I wanted to
                set my window manager to behave like fvwm (in the
                autopanning sense of the word) when I discovered this.

        Mon Oct 11 09:14:58 PDT 1993 leisner@eso.mc.xerox.com (Marty Leisner)
                Included small patches to Imakefile from Marty Leisner.

        Mon Oct 11 17:04:35 EDT 1993 dsembr01
                NoDefaultTitleButtons
                NoDefaultMouseAndKeyboardBindings
                so someone could use either the default title or 
                keyboard bindings, but not necessarily both.

============ vtwm-5.2.2.tar.gz =============

        dsembr01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu (Darren S. Embry)
                Used another bug workaround to support negative door
                geometries; the old one I did messed up with positive door
                geometries, especially "+0+0".

============ vtwm-5.2.1.tar.gz =============

        dsembr01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu (Darren S. Embry)
                AutoPanBorderWidth
                AutoPanExtraWarp
                AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen
                EnhancedExecResources
                LessRandomZoomZoom
                NaturalAutopanBehavior
                PrettyZoom
                RealScreenBorderWidth
                RightHandSidePulldownMenus

                Support for negative and "0,0" door geometries.
